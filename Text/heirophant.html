<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I come here to combat the fraud and illusion of your conventional,
institutionalized religion. As with all such religions, your institution
moves toward cowardice, it moves toward mediocrity, inertia, and self-satisfaction.
<I>-Frank Herbert, Children of Dune</I></FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you're reading this paper, it means I've given it to
you because you were proselytizing to me and you are a Christian. I'm giving
you this paper to save us both some time; you see, I'm not a Christian,
although I used to be. I'm a secular humanist, and I became one for both
logical and emotive reasons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Since I've been a Christian, I do know quite a bit about
the religion, although I might not know much about your particular sect.
(I use the word sect instead of denomination because I think it unfair
that Christians get denominations, which is a nice-sounding word, while
everyone else gets sects, which is an evil-sounding word). I became a non-Christian
because I didn't like what I knew about the Christian religion. If you
want to even begin attempting to convert me, you have to settle those problems.
Specifically, you have to answer the questions below. Answers to each question
should be typed or neatly handwritten on a separate sheet (or sheets) of
paper, and no answer should exceed 100 words. This is because one of the
reasons I left Christianity is that it was so complex, and I've found that
the simplest answer to a question is usually the right one. Quotes from
scripture count for bonus points as long as you can refute other quotes
from scripture that contradict the pass! age that you are quoting. If you
return this paper to me personally, or if you mail it to me, and if I think
that your answers justify my return to Christianity, then I will get in
touch with you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>You should also read and study the attached papers, as
you will be quizzed on them if I decide I like your answers to these questions;
they describe, in part, my own religious beliefs, and I don't see why I
should bother to learn about your religious beliefs if you won't take the
time to learn about mine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The questions follow. Under no circumstances will &quot;The
LORD works in mysterious ways&quot; or other arguments in that vein be
acceptable. If a question does not apply to your particular sect, explain
why. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thank you! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>0. If necessary, use this space to explain any unique
beliefs your sect has about the nature of your god, heaven, hell, the Bible,
the Holy Spirit/Ghost, Satan, etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. Explain why your god's only son had to die so we can
go to magic happy land when we croak. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. Did everyone who died before Jesus died go to Hell?
Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3. If a Catholic, justify the Inquisition and other persecutions
of &quot;heretics&quot; throughout the centuries, concentrating on why
the Pelagianists, the Priscillianists, and the Manichaeans were persecuted;
if a Protestant, justify the witch trials and the way that Protestants
constantly hunted down native Americans until there were so few that the
government could simply take their land; if a member of an Eastern Orthodox
church, justify the persecutions of the Old Believers after the reforms
of the seventeenth century. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4. Explain why your sect (whether Catholic, Protestant,
or Eastern Orthodox) pursued, tortured, and killed people who were not
Christian. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>5. Explain why your sect (whether Catholic, Protestant,
or Eastern Orthodox) pursued, tortured, and killed people who were not
members of your particular sect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>6. Explain why I should believe that your god is all-good
when the only real information we have about him is the Bible, which clearly
describes him as both good and evil. (See Isaiah 30:32, Luke 14:26, Numbers
31:17-18, Matthew 10:34, Amos 3:6, Deuteronomy 18:8, Deuteronomy 20:16,
Exodus 20:5, Exodus 32:27, Isaiah 45:7, Psalms 52:5, Luke 22:36, and Jeremiah
18:11 for a small sample of Biblical passages which describe Jehovah as
having an evil morality at times). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>7. Explain why, when racism is clearly wrong, Jesus was
clearly a racist (see Mark 7:25-29). NOTE: under no circumstances will
I believe the idea that racism is morally acceptable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>8. Explain why, when discrimination against women is clearly
wrong, the Bible clearly supports the oppression of women. Answering this
question entails refuting 1 Cor 11 and 1 Tim 2:11-15. NOTE: under no circumstances
will I believe that discrimination against women solely on the basis of
sex is morally acceptable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>9. Explain why, when slavery is clearly wrong, the Bible
clearly supports slavery. Answering this question entails refuting 1 Peter
2:18. NOTE: under no circumstances will I believe that slavery is an acceptable
way to run a society. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>10. Explain why children should submit to their parents'
decisions even when those decisions are clearly evil. Answering this question
entails refuting Deuteronomy 21:18-21, Proverbs 13:24, and Hebrews 12:7-8.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>11. Explain why, if your god loves us all, more than half
of us are going to Hell after we die. Specifically, refute or explain the
following words of Christ, as presented in the New Testament: &quot;Many
are called but few are chosen,&quot; and &quot;Straight is the gate, and
narrow is the way that leadeth unto salvation, and few there be that find
it.&quot; If your god loves all of us, couldn't he find a better way? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>12. Explain what type of offense could possibly justify
eternal, unbearable torture in Hell; if your sect does not believe in Hell,
then refute every passage in the Old and New Testaments which describes
Hell (such as 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9 and Revelation 20:15). Do not exceed
100 words. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>13. Explain how your god can be both just and merciful,
when these terms apparently contradict each other. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>14. Explain why possession by demons and/or other evil
spirits was common during the time of Jesus, but hardly mentioned in the
Old Testament, and apparently has been explained completely away today
by things such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>15. Explain why, if the personality resides in the soul,
things like drugs and brain damage can affect someone's personality. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>16. If heaven is a place where everyone is perfectly happy,
then explain how I could be happy in heaven if I had loved ones in Hell.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>17. What is Heaven like? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>18. What is Hell like? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>19. Explain why original sin exists. Why should I be eternally
tortured for something that a pair of naked fruit-munching simpletons did
in a garden over six thousand years ago? If you believe that children are
born stained because they were conceived sexually, explain why I would
be punished for something my parents did by your merciful and just god.
If this does not apply to your sect, explain why. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>20. Explain why getting dunked in or sprinkled with water
will prevent me from being eternally tortured for the actions of the naked
fruit-munching simpletons mentioned in #19. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>21. If your god did not want Adam and Eve to eat from
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, why did he put the tree in the
garden of Eden (and at the center, no less)? Was it for shade? If so, why
use something so dangerous as a shade tree? If the purpose of the tree
was to tempt Adam and Eve, explain why it's OK for your god to engage in
a practice that our modern-day courts of law refer to as &quot;entrapment.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>22. Explain why sex, potentially one of the most wonderful,
beautiful things in human nature, is considered &quot;bad&quot; by your
particular sect. If your sect does not consider sex to be &quot;bad,&quot;
then refute Matthew 19:12, 1 Corinthians 7 (particularly verses 1 and 9),
Galatians 5:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, James 1:14-15, Matthew 24:38, Luke
17:27, and Revelation 14:4. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>23. Explain why, if Jesus was perfect, he thought that
the end of the world was coming soon, when it has clearly not come yet.
See Matthew 16:27-28. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>24. Explain why some people (James, Peter, Paul, Thomas,
etc.) should get convincing physical proof of miracles, while the rest
of us are supposed to take these happenings on faith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>25. Why are the stories of the resurrection inconsistent?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>26. If you are a Protestant or a member of an Eastern
Orthodox church, explain why you are still using the Catholic Bible, which
was formalized by a vote among (supposedly divinely inspired) cardinals
and bishops in the fourth century CE, when you disagree with the idea that
the Pope, who is higher in the Catholic hierarchy, is divinely inspired;
if a Catholic, explain why your church accepts the canonical Bible while
rejecting the Apocrypha (do not use the &quot;divinely inspired&quot; argument:
Because I am not religious, I will not be able to accept it). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>27. If your god is kind and gentle, why do some animals
have to eat meat? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>28. If your god is kind and gentle, why did he create
parasites? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>29. If your god wants us to worship him through our own
free will, why does he threaten us with Hell? If you have someone threatening
you with a punishment, it isn't free will. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>30. Why would your god deliberately cause sinners to sin
(cf. Romans 9:15-23 and numerous parts of the book of Exodus where Jehovah
says, &quot;I will harden Pharaoh's heart.&quot;). Are these sinners still
responsible for the sins which your god forces them, against their will,
to commit? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>31. If Jesus did have to die, why did someone (specifically,
Judas) have to be damned in order accomplish the death and resurrection
of Jesus? Jesus was at least a volunteer for the cross; I doubt that your
god asked Judas if he was willing to go to Hell so that the resurrection
could be accomplished. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>32. If Judas was willing to go to Hell for humanity (see
#31), didn't he make more of a sacrifice than Jesus, who spent only three
hours in pain? Shouldn't we then be worshipping Judas? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>33. Why should we accept the words of the gospel writers
as truth when they are known to be liars? (See Romans 3:7). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>34. Do you believe that your god is anti-homosexual? If
so, explain why he would create homosexuals in the first place. If not,
refute or explain away Leviticus 20:13 and Romans 1:26-27. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>35. Explain why prayer is OK, but spell casting is not,
when both amount to the same thing: requesting that a superior supernatural
force to intercede in a way that would be impossible according to the normally
accepted laws of physics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>36. According to the Gospels, from the Christian standpoint,
Jesus was the most important person to ever live. From the Roman standpoint,
Jesus was a huge pain in the ass because of his political activities. Explain
why nothing was written about his life for over thirty years after his
death, and nothing except the Gospels was written until the third century
CE. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>37. Explain why you believe a person whose life is so
poorly documented (see #36) was even ever born. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>38. Define the word &quot;Christ,&quot; including references
to the pagan origins and meaning of the word. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>39. Explain why Jesus, who was anti-Gentile (see Mark
7:25-29) and anti-sex (see Luke 14:26 and Matthew 19:12), would want to
be anointed with oil in a pagan sexual rite after his death (see your definition
for #38). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>40. In light of Matthew 10:34, explain why Jesus is called
the Prince of Peace. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>41. The name &quot;Jesus&quot; has been anglicized. What
was the original (Hebrew) name of Jesus? Where did you get this information?
This is a bonus question. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>42. Why is it that the life of Jesus was so similar to
the lives of pagan Christs, particularly Herakles, Dionysios, and Asklepios?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>43. If your god requires that people believe in him and
follow his orders through their own free will, why do Christians push their
views on public policy? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>44. Explain why being a good Christian requires you to
push your beliefs on others. If you do not believe that you have to push
your views on others (no matter how much this annoys them), explain why
you do not believe this despite the fact that the New Testament seems to
suggest that you must do this to get to Heaven (for instance, in Matthew
28:19-20). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>45. Explain why spreading the &quot;truth of Christ&quot;
requires you to spread lies about other religions, such as the idea that
Wiccans (so-called &quot;white witches&quot;) worship the Christian devil.
(Incidentally, they don't, and this rumor has been persistently spread
by Christians since the second century CE). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>46. At no point in the four Gospels did Jesus claim to
be the son of your god. (He said &quot;son of man&quot; quite frequently,
and at one point referred to himself as &quot;a son of god,&quot; but that
was a common Hebrew expression at the time. Someone who was &quot;a son
of god&quot; was a Jew. This reflected the Israelites' belief that they
were the chosen people of your god. See Job 1:6). Why, then, do you believe
that Jesus was divine? If you don't believe that Jesus was divine, then
why do you call yourself a Christian? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>47. Given the fact that Jesus did not say anything original
(the Golden Rule and the &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; idea were stolen
from Buddhism; and the Beatitudes were common in the Jewish devotional
literature at the time), why do you see Jesus as such a great thinker/
philosopher/ ethicist? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>48. When Jesus said, &quot;Resist not evil: but whosoever
shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,&quot;
why do you suppose that most Christians fight for their rights? To put
it another way, why don't we, as a country of 85% Christians, let the government
abuse us? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>49. Why are so many Christian holidays on the same day
as Pagan holidays? Couldn't the early Church fathers have converted pagans
only by appealing to their reason and/or faith if Christianity is the true
religion? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>50. Explain how your god can be &quot;just and merciful&quot;
in light of Exodus 20:5. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>51. Do you believe that the Old Testament should be accepted
as part of Christian theology? If so, explain how you can worship such
a cruel, sadistic asshole (see Numbers 31:17-18, Deuteronomy 20:16, Proverbs
20:30, Amos 3:6, Deuteronomy 13:8, Psalms 3:7, Psalms 52:5, etc.); if not,
explain how you can believe that Jesus is the promised savior sent by your
god without the messianic prophecies and the ruling rights of the line
of David, both of which are in the Old Testament in books such as Isaiah,
Zechariah, Daniel, Psalms, etc. (as opposed to, say, believing that Jesus
was an irritating nut wandering around saying things that people didn't
like much). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>52. Explain why your &quot;just and merciful&quot; god
sent bears to kill forty-two children who called his prophet Elisha &quot;baldhead.&quot;
(See 2 Kings 2:23-24). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>53. If prostitution is wrong, why are there so many examples
of it in Genesis? (For instance, Gen 19:8, where Lot offers his daughters
to a mob so that his guests can avoid gang rape). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>54. What is the sin that people committed that is so incredibly
bad that your god had to become flesh and die to correct? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>55. Are all members of other faiths bad? Are they all
damned to Hell? Justify your answer with quotes from the Bible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>56. Are all atheists/agnostics/humanists bad? Are they
all damned to Hell? Justify your answer with quotes from the Bible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>57. What was your motive in proselytizing to me? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>58. Where is Heaven? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>59. Where is Hell? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>60. Why don't animals go to heaven or hell when they die?
What makes us so special? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>61. Why does Satan try to get peoples' souls? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>62. Once Satan has someone's soul, what does he do with
it? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>63. Is your god perfect? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>64. Where does our soul stay while we are alive? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>65. Explain how you can believe in Satan when your faith
is directly descended from the Jewish faith, when the Jews did not even
believe in Satan until they absorbed the Egyptian god Set while they were
captives in Egypt. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>66. Why do evil people often prosper? Justify your answer.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>67. Why do good people so often fail to prosper? Justify
your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>68. When the end of the world comes, will your god raise
our actual bodies, or just our souls? Explain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>69. Explain why your god lets airplanes with sinless infants
on board crash. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>70. What is sin, exactly? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>71. If Jesus is perfect, justify the parable of the fig
tree (Matthew 21:17-19, Mark 11:14-20). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>72. Explain why Christians have harassed Wiccans (&quot;white
witches&quot;) for almost two thousand years now, when the central rule
of the Wiccan ethical system is &quot;an it harm no one, do what thou wilt.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>73. Explain why Christians (yes, that includes all branches
of Christianity) have spread the lie that Jews put Jesus to death when,
in actuality, it was the Romans who put Jesus to death. (For a good example
of New Testament anti-semetism, see 1 Thessalonians 2:15). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>74. Explain why your god created humans as imperfect,
then set his standards so high that no one could possibly live up to them,
then punishes us for not living up to his standards. Doesn't this also
constitute &quot;entrapment?&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>75. If we are created in your god's image and likeness
(Gen 1:27), how can we also be imperfect? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>76. Why was it OK for the ancient Israelites to sacrifice
animals to their god, while it is wrong for modern religions to sacrifice
animals to their gods? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>77. Why would your god confuse people? (See 1 Sam 7:10
and Gen 11:9). Isn't life confusing enough already? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>78. Why would your god cause blindness, deafness, and
dumbness? (See Ex 4:11) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>79. Why would your god want to damn people by making them
believe false things? (See 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>80. Should the book of Revelation be taken literally?
Explain your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>81. Would it be good for men to castrate themselves? Justify
your answer, taking Matthew 19:12 into account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>82. What exactly is faith? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>83. All of the various Christian sects ignore parts of
the Bible, usually because those parts of the Bible are inconvenient. Explain
which parts of the Bible your sect ignores, and explain why it is OK to
ignore those parts of the Bible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>84. Why did your god allow Satan to do evil things to
Job (Job 2:7 etc.)? Wouldn't your god better spend his time punishing unbelievers?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>85. If Jesus and his father are one (John 10:30), then
why does Jesus have to pray (i.e. Matthew 26:39)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>86. Explain your belief in heaven in light of Job 7:9
and Ecclesiastes 9:5. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>87. Christ giving himself up on the cross was a great
gesture, true, but wouldn't it have been more sensible for him to continue
spreading his message until he died a natural death? Answer this question
in light of your answer to question #1. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>88. What is your interpretation of the temptation of Christ
by Satan in the desert (Matthew 4:5-8, Luke 4:5-9)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>89. In view of Matthew 6:5-6, shouldn't prayer in public
schools be discouraged? Support your answer with scripture quotes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>90. Do you feel that the last words of Christ were significant?
If so, why do the four gospels attribute three different sentences to Christ
as his last? (Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34: &quot;My God, My God, why hast
thou forsaken me?&quot;; Luke 23:46: &quot;Father, into thy hands I commend
my spirit&quot;; John 19:30: &quot;It is finished&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>91. Matthew and Mark say that the last words of Christ
were, in Hebrew, &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot; This has traditionally
been translated as, &quot;My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;
However, a more accurate translation would be, &quot;My El, My El, why
has thou forsaken me?&quot; El is the name of a specific pagan god. Why
would Jesus call out to a pagan god at the moment of his death? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>92. A commonly recited litany in many forms of Christianity
is &quot;The LORD is my shepherd.&quot; (Psalm 23:1). Given the fact that
the only reasons that people raise sheep are to rob them of their clothes
and to kill them for meat, and the fact that sheep will often follow the
shepherd to their destruction, do you think that this is any appropriate
image for your god? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>93. Why is the theory of the big bang any more (or less)
likely that the idea that your god created the universe? Justify your answer.
NOTE: I admit that science has not explained where the original supercondensed
particle came from, but no one has ever explained where your god came from,
either. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>94. If your god is everywhere at the same time, and hell
is the absence of (or separation from) your god, how can he be omnipotent?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>95. In the Genesis story, your god tells Adam and Eve
that the day they eat from the tree of knowledge they will surely die (Gen
2:17). The devil tells them that they will not die, but that their eyes
would be opened and they would know the difference between good and evil
(Gen 3:5). Wasn't Satan telling the truth here? Is your god a liar? Justify
your answer in light of Jeremiah 20:7 and Ezekiel 14:9. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>96. If Lucifer is not as powerful as your god, then he
cannot possibly be omnipresent. How could he possibly get as many followers
as you seem to think he has? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>97. The Bible constantly describes your god as male. In
view of the fact that your god supposedly created everything, and creation
is very much a female function, isn't this at least a little bit absurd?
Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>98. In light of the Trinity, angels, the Virgin Mary,
etc., isn't Christianity polytheistic? If the Trinity is three who are
one, why the three names? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>99. Have you read the entire Bible? If not, how can you
be devoted enough to try and convert me to a religion that you don't know
that much about? Isn't knowing as much as possible about something necessary
to understanding it? Isn't understanding something necessary to being completely
devoted to it? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>100. Why is 2 Kings 19 exactly identical to Isaiah 37?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>101. Is Jesus's three days in Hell really an ultimate
sacrifice, when more than half of humanity going to spend eternity there
(see question #11)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>102. If your sect considers the King James Bible to be
the official and/or authoritative translation, justify this in light of
the fact that when King James commissioned his translation to be poetic
rather than accurate. How can you possibly use an inaccurate translation
as your reference for what is/is not the word of your god? If your sect
does not use the King James Bible, what translation do they use? Justify
the use of that particular translation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>103. Assume that I do not believe that Jesus died for
my sins, or that if he did, that necessarily means I will go to your heaven.
Name one thing that Jesus ever did for me. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>104. Before Mary was knocked up by the Holy Spirit/Ghost,
she was never asked for her consent. (She was warned; see Luke 1:31). Mary
was also asleep when your god knocked her up; this strongly suggests that
he didn't want her to protest. Does this mean that Mary was raped by your
god? Do you think rape is wrong? Explain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>105 According to Luke, Mary knew that she was pregnant
with the Messiah. Living in the times she lived in, she must have known
the scripture; therefore, she must have known that he would have to suffer
horribly during his life. Was it moral for Mary to carry her baby to term,
or would it have been more humane for her to have an abortion? Explain.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>106. If it was foretold that Jesus was to be crucified,
and if he knew this, and if he was the son of your god, why did he do everything
he could to avoid being crucified? (See, for instance, Matthew 26:39).
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>107. If the Holy Spirit/Ghost is the father of Jesus (Luke
1:35), then why is the central figure of your trinity called God the Father?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>108. Mary and Jehovah were never joined in wedlock. Does
it bother you that Jesus is technically a bastard? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>109. The original Hebrew word for the Holy Ghost/Spirit
includes the idea that the Holy Spirit/Ghost is female in gender. Isn't
this rather silly when you consider the fact that the Holy Ghost/Spirit
is actually the father of Jesus (Luke 1:35)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>110. Matthew 28:11-15 contains an account of a conspiracy
between the Jews and the Roman soldiers to spread the story that the disciples
stole the body of Christ. How could Matthew have known about this, since
no Jews or Romans would have admitted to it? If it was such a transparent
conspiracy that an outsider could have seen it, why didn't the other three
gospels mention it? Why didn't the Roman soldiers get into trouble? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>111. Jews believe that people are basically good people
and can work to overcome their sinful tendencies. Most Christian sects,
following the teaching of Psalm 51:5, 1 Kings 8:46, Ezekiel 18:4, Isaiah
59:2, and Psalm 143:2, believe that people are completely debased and hopelessly
lost in sin, and that only your god can lift us out of this state if he
decides to bestow his gift of grace on us? Isn't this an incredibly negative
view of people? Isn't Judaism a more mature faith just for this reason?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>112. How do you, as an individual, feel about Psalm 51:5?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>113. What does your sect teach about Psalm 51:5 (and 1
Kings 8:46, etc.), predestination, and similar matters? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>114. Don't you think that the idea that no matter what
we do, we can never be good and righteous without help from your god (Isaiah
64:6) fosters an unnatural and unhealthy dependency on him? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>115. Revelation 22:16 says that Jesus is the &quot;offspring
of David.&quot; Mary was not descended from David, but Joseph was. Doesn't
this mean that Jesus wasn't the son of your god at all, but the (mortal
and not divine) son of Joseph? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>116. What would the correct thing to do be if your god
gave you a command that was harmful and/or destructive to you? A common
argument, which comes from Paul, states that because clay pots don't complain
about what the potter does with them, people shouldn't complain about what
their maker (supposedly, your god) does with them, but this completely
ignores the vitally important argument that clay pots have no sense of
self-awareness and cannot think or feel love, pain, anger, etc. If you
want to make this argument, you have to deal with this difference. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>117. What (or who) does your sect believe the number 666
represents? Justify your answer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>118. If your god is &quot;just and merciful,&quot; why
would he take Solomon's kingdom away from Solomon's son while not punishing
Solomon, when it was Solomon himself who committed the sin of idolatry?
What did Solomon's son do to deserve punishment? (See 1 Kings 11:12). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>119. Why is Solomon commonly considered to be the paragon
of wisdom by many Christians, when he constantly sinned against your god
(1 Kings 11:4-10, etc.)? Personally, if I had a god talking to me, I'd
do what he said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>120. Don't you think that an anti-sex position (see question
#22) is a rather silly position for your sect to take when the biblical
book &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; is a piece of erotic poetry? (For instance,
in Song of Solomon 8:2, the bridegroom proposes to &quot;drink of spiced
wine of the juice of the pomegranate.&quot; The pomegranate was a symbol
of the female genitalia, and the &quot;spiced wine&quot; represented menstrual
blood). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>121. Does it bother you that the cross, supposedly a Christian
symbol, was actually stolen from the Egyptians? Why or why not? (The Egyptian
cross, the ankh, was a male-female symbol similar in concept to the yin-yang.
When the Christians stole the ankh from the Egyptians, they removed the
female symbol, or yoni, leaving only the masculine symbol-- a subtle way
of reinforcing the idea that women are lesser beings). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>122. How do you explain that Christians are twice as likely
to have sadomasochistic tendencies as non-christians? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>123. What is the incredibly important doctrinal difference
that requires the fighting between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>124. Even if your god did create the universe, why does
he want to be worshipped? Is your god an egomaniac? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>125. What are your beliefs concerning Wicca? (&quot;white
witchcraft&quot;). How much do you know about Wicca? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>126. What do you think the word &quot;Satanist&quot; means?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>127. How do you explain the fact that the word &quot;blood&quot;
occurs over 400 times in the Bible? Isn't this a rather savage way to write
a book that is supposed to be at the center of an ethical system? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>128. Throughout the Bible, your god commands his followers
to wage merciless war on unbelievers (Luke 22:36, Deuteronomy 13:8, Exodus
20:23-25, Deuteronomy 20:16, Matthew 10:34, Numbers 31:17-18, etc). If
you are one of his followers, why aren't you out waging merciless war on
unbelievers? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>129. Numbers 23:21 says that your god &quot;has not seen
wickedness in Israel.&quot; If this is so, explain why your god burned
Israelites for complaining (Num 11:1), sent a plague against them for eating
the meat he had given them (Num 11:33), why he burned people for using
incense (Num 16:35), why he sent a plague against the Israelites who accused
Moses of wrongdoing (Num 16:44-49), and why he sent fiery snakes among
the Israelites (Num 21:5). Is your god a liar, or was it just more convenient
for him to lie at that particular place and time, or what? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>130. What was it that was so bad about eating an apple
that death had to result from that act? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>131. What was it about humanity's torturing and killing
of your god's only son that made your god so happy that he again promised
eternal life to everyone who believed in him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>132. How do you explain that Matthew and Luke give different
genealogies for Jesus? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>133. Matthew says that the prophecy given in Matthew 27:9
was given by Jeremiah. How do you explain that this prophecy was not given
by Jeremiah at all, but by Zechariah (in Zech 11:12)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>134. Matthew says (in Matt 2:21) that Jesus dealt in Nazareth
so that he could fulfill a prophecy stating that the Messiah would be called
a Nazarene. Where is this prophecy in the Old Testament? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>135. Matthew says that on the triumphant entry into Jerusalem,
Jesus was riding on an ass and a colt (Matt 21:7). How do you explain that
the original prophecy (Zech 9:9) stated that Jesus would be riding on only
one ass, and the other gospel writers place Jesus only on one ass (Mark
11:7, Luke 19:35, and John 12:15)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>136. In Matthew 1:23, Matthew has the angel say that Jesus
would be born of a virgin. However, the prophecy that Matthew is referring
to, Isaiah 7:14, uses the Hebrew word almah, which simply means a young
woman. It has nothing to do with sexual purity; the Hebrew word for virgin
is bethulah. How do you explain this? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>137. Isaiah 7:16 seems to say that before Jesus had reached
the age of maturity, both of the Jewish countries would be destroyed. Where
is the fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>138. Matthew 1:23 says that Jesus would be called Immanuel,
which means &quot;God with us.&quot; Why does no one (not even his parents)
call him Immanuel at any point in the New Testament? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>139. How many inconsistencies in the Bible, other than
those mentioned in this paper, do you know of? Cite chapter and verse for
as many as you have room for. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>140. If even the contemplation of sinning is a sin (i.e.
&quot;sinning in your heart&quot;; see, for example, Matthew 5:28) and
if Jesus was tempted by Satan in the desert (Matthew 4:5-8, Luke 4:5-9),
how can you say that Jesus was without sin? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>141. Does your sect believe that the existence of your
god can be established through a formal proof? Why or why not? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>142. Pick a famous argument for the existence of your
god, then criticize that argument. (Assume I mean for you to use the academic
definition of criticize). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>143. Pick an argument against the existence of your god.
If it is not a famous argument, copy it down here. Criticize this argument.
(Assume I mean for you to use the academic definition of the word criticize).
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>144. What does your sect think of the government? Read
Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 13. Now what do you think of the government?
If necessary, reconcile the two views. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>145. What is your definition of the word Christian? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>146. Why do you think it is that the ancient Greeks, who
had a very liberal sexual morality, had many fewer sex crimes (compared
to the population) than the United States, which is 85% Christian? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>147. If someone accepts Jesus, and is &quot;saved,&quot;
but then turns away from Jesus, is that person still saved? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>148. Where did your god come from? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>149. What are the requirements for being saved? Some sects
says that faith alone is enough; others say that faith without works is
dead. The Bible supports both these viewpoints. What does your sect think?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>150. If I decide I like the answers to the above questions,
where can I get in touch with you? (Give name, address, phone and email
if available). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>151. What is the name of your sect? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>152. How is your sect organized? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>153. How can I get in touch with a priest (minister, etc.)
of your sect? </FONT></P>
