We are not yet finished with screen ruler, a little useful cracking tool which you'll be able to download <a href="ruler.zip" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/ruler.zip">here</a>. You'll find my original essay about this interesting cracking tool <a href="tppmsgs/msgs8.htm#841" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#229">here</a>, with a stimulating add-on by Frog's print. The original work was about adding some functionalities to the target, and is part of the +HCU's &quot;crippledwarez &amp; functionalities adding&quot; <a href="project6.htm" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/project6.htm">project 6</a><br><br>
I was recently fumbling around with my copy of screen ruler (that I have modified quite a lot) and as I eliminated the original one from my hard disk, I was puzzled by a small protection (if you want to call that a &quot;protection&quot;) that I had not reversed in my original essay. I didn't even see it :(<br>In fact the code of this target checks for the existence of two files on your hard disk: its registration file and another help file. If you delete them, as I did when I deleted the original, it snaps.<br>This is  a very 
common scheme, since many shareware authors like their products to be distributed with all their parts.<br>Usually a simple run of filemonitor will alert you about this and land you directly with a good search string for your dead listing.<br>The protection inside this target is indeed absolutely simple, yet we'll use it in order to learn <font color="blue">another</font> very useful trick for our reverse engineering purposes: the &quot;CALL RELOCATION&quot; table.<br><br>Here is the part of the code where screen ruler checks the &quot;existence&quot; of its &quot;registration file&quot; (sreg.txt) and of, 
its &quot;text&quot; help file (sruler.txt). I cannot understand why a target  
should perform such an important checking in this &quot;easygoing&quot; way... In fact even a 
stupid luser could 
just prepare his own file, saving with the name &quot;sruler.txt&quot; a text file
where he wrote something, let's say the phrase &quot;Hi guys, I'm sruler.txt!&quot; and, loo 
and behold, he would be done :-)<br> 
Here is my SYNTHETIZED listing of this part of the code, please note the two lines in red (in fact who calls it and where does it return):</i>

</pre><font size="+1">
Well, there is not much to say about this codesnippet... the checking uses a 
function that is really intended for EXECUTABLES (the 31 possible error codes have a lot to do with executables) just in order to check for the presence of the other two files of 
the &quot;bundle&quot;. As you should immediately see here, you can easily trick this stupid code into returning a good flag, or, as I said, you can write your own &quot;faked&quot; files...<br>But, just wait a minute: 
would it not be nice if we could find WHERE this snippet is called from in our target? Yes, sure, but how the hell are we going to know FROM THE DEAD LISTING where did the call come from? There is (apparently) nowhere in the code a call to the beginning of the above code snippet at :00401739. No jumping here, no calls, how did the target get here?<br>We'll have to load and fire winice and trace back...<br>
NO! Here is a nice trick that +ORC has teached us long ago, time to explain it to all future +crackers!<br><br><font size="+2"><center>Dead listing using the CALL RELOCATION TABLE!</font></center>
<br>
In order to find where the above code snippet is called from we'll have to 
have a look at the CODE TABLES of our target (use hexworkshop and search for the 
hex string &quot;39174000&quot;, i.e. the start location of the procedure above... <u>our</u> location in INVERTED hex sequence):</font><pre>
7DC0: 00000000000000000000000000446174
7DD0: 610000000000000000002E354000E112       ;table begins at 7DDA, duh
      4000BF134000DC174000F5174000BD1B
      400046214000BA254000D6144000FB23
      4000922840004C2B4000B12C40000634     
      40004D1340004E2A40000A2E4000F12E
      40009B2A4000EE264000922F4000AB30
      40007918400064144000A42340006431
7E40: 400067194000<font color="red"><u>39174000</u></font>FB3340000000       ;table ends at 7E4A (+70), duh
7E50: 5555AAAA5555AAAA5555AAAA5555AAAA</pre><font size="+1">
You dig it, don't you? In fact these tables, near the bottom of almost all windows files, 
are very useful for our reverse engineering purposes (that's the real reason 
I wanted to show you the stupid protection snippet above)... looking at them you can 
immediately get the addresses of various important calls: here you have</font><pre>
:0040352E      ;at the bottom
:004012E1      ;at the bottom+4
:004013BF      ;at the bottom+8
...
:403164        ;at bottom+64
:401967        ;at bottom+68
:401739        ;(our nag call) at bottom+6C
:4033FB        ;at the top (=+70)
</pre><font size="+1">
And you will now be able to easily examine each one of the other... Yet you can do even more! Much more!
Since you can see the &quot;bottom&quot; of this table at 7DDA, you'll know that you have 
here 7DDA = :0040352E, 7DDA+4 (=7DDE= :0040121E), 7DDA+8 (=7DE2 = :004013BF)... until 
you get to our 7E46= :00401739_call_nag_if_missing_file, which is 7DDA+6C. You dig it: each 4 bytes we have, in this table, the beginning of a routine.<br>
What the hell should we care! Will you cry exasperated by all this. Well, look at this nice piece of code, inside our target, that is not supposed to say us anything, look:</font>
<pre>
:004012E1 55                      push ebp
:004012E2 89E5                    mov ebp, esp
:004012E4 53                      push ebx
:004012E5 83EC04                  sub esp, 00000004
:004012E8 894DF8                  mov dword ptr [ebp-08], ecx
:004012EB 89C8                    mov eax, ecx
:004012ED 8B4D08                  mov ecx, dword ptr [ebp+08]
:004012F0 894804                  mov dword ptr [eax+04], ecx
:004012F3 89C1                    mov ecx, eax
:004012F5 8B19                    mov ebx, dword ptr [ecx]
:004012F7 FF536C                  call [ebx+6C]   ;<font color="red">HERE!</font>
:004012FA 89C1                    mov ecx, eax
:004012FC 09C9                    or ecx, ecx
:004012FE 7502                    jne 00401302
:00401300 EB26                    jmp 00401328
</pre><font size="+1">
We could just look at this code snippet until our eyes start dazzling, and we would 
never understand anything without some laborious softicing. Or would we?<br>
In fact this is NOT a protection trick, it is the result of the COMPILATION of our 
target, yet it amounts to the same &quot;confusing&quot; effect for us reverse engineers if you 
will not use the &quot;table relocation countermeasures&quot; I'm explaining you now.<br>OK guys, I know, you already understood the whole point<br>Let's rewrite the &quot;awful&quot; code 
snippet above in &quot;our&quot; way:</font>
<pre>
:004012E1 55       push ebp       ;value corresponds to a &quot;call [<font color="red">ebx+4</font>]&quot; somewhere
...                               ;prepare call
:004012F7 FF536C   call [<font color="red">ebx+6C</font>]  ;call table value 00401739_nag_if_missing_file
:004012FA 89C1     mov ecx, eax   ;get return value
:004012FC 09C9     or ecx, ecx    ;is it zero (=bad)
:004012FE 7502     jne 00401302   ;no, continue
:00401300 EB26     jmp 00401328   ;yes, beggar off</pre><font size="+1">
Well, it makes MUCH more sense, doesn't it?... now, how is this for our &quot;dead listing&quot; purposes? Quite good, I would say, and there is no need whatsoever to fire winice in order to understand such &quot;awful&quot; dead listing snippets any more... note that I agree unconditionally with +ORC on this: good dead listing sipping a nice cocktail in 
the shadows of a nice garden beats head down any eye - fatiguing live winicing :-)<br>
In fact, who cares about the values in ebx and how they get there, and all the mischievous (or innocent) manipulations of those values any more? Once we know that there is a base for all relocated calls, those values &quot;should&quot; correspond (and indeed, almost always, they will) to the values inside our table of calls.<br>Therefore the cryptic &quot;call [ebx+4C]&quot; will 
correspond (here in our target) to a simple call 7E26 (i.e.:004026EE), whereby the mysterious &quot;call [ebx+64]&quot; 
will simply call the routine value hardcoded at 7E3E (i.e.:00403164). And so on and so on! Everything is SO easy! Reverse engineering, my dear readers, is just a little feeling, a little luck and a little help! (and a little brain too, you'll often need one :-)<br><br>
<font size="+2">
<b>Learn this, once for ever</b></font><br>
You should ALWAYS have a look at these tables when you dead list a program, you should ALWAYS calculate their base and you should ALWAYS prepare a copy of said table, in order to integrate it to your &quot;dead listing&quot;.<br>
Use this trick to give <u>meaningful tags</u> to the numerous 
&quot;relocated&quot; calls that you'll find inside the snippets of your compiled targets... you'll notice pretty soon 
the incredible difference that this will mean for your understanding of the code!<br>
Always remember +ORC's &quot;Zen&quot; teachings:</font><font color="purple">
<br><pre>Your wordprocessor's search and replace facilities will be more 
useful than ANY other tool when trying to &quot;feel&quot; your targets, and you 
will feel the code, provided you have the necessary peace of mind: do 
not, never, ran amok inside the dark codewoods, they are full of thorns. 
Learn the names of the common structures and give meaningful names to all 
things that <u>you</u> discover along your journey. If you have done your
homework, a brain and a pencil are all what you will need to crack ANY 
target</font></pre>
<font size="+1">Well, I love working with my brain and my colored staedtler pencils!</font><br><br>
