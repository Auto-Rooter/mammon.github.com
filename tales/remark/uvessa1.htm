<h4>AUDITORIUM:</h4>

<p>In this essay I'll try to cover the most specific problems that a NEWBEE
till SEMY-ADVANCED cracker will encounter at the beginning of his career. 
My text includes simple nag-screen
(-dialogs) removing, limit-protection cracking, fishing serialz, and some elements of 
key- generator programming. <br>
I'll try to submit you my opinion about what &quot;really&quot; cracking
should be. I think, since limit protections of any kind should be defended
in any way you fancy, cracking a online-registration target should always
include at least one &quot;true&quot; Serial Number matching your key.
Most of the cracks roaming the Web are just quick-and-dirty rejump-ed
schemes... and you can never be sure of their efficiency as the targets are actually 
NOT registered at all! You can avoid some ugly surprise later only if you
see your target answering with the message: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#B22222">Thank You for ...</font><font COLOR="#000000">(...that you gave me your money!)</font></pre>

<p>after the registering prompt AND your own User Name (handle) inside the 
Help-About dialog... &quot;as it should be&quot;.
<br>
Furthermore, to reverse the algorithm itself is one of the higher arts of our trade, 
 and it is a useful exercise indeed.<br>
The reader is supposed to be familiar with our main tools - SoftIce and
W32Dasm - at some beginners level too, I'll not teach you here how to
load exports or how to set breakpoints: there are many other good essays covering
these themes. <br>
I have collected some targets that I have cracked sincelast August.
I hope I established some graduation too, so you'll be prepared for the
more difficult jobs at the end.<br>
And... excuse my horrible english too... <br>
And now lets start, putting our targets one after another. </p>

</p>

<h4>GENERAL APPROACH:</h4>

<p>Since +He went over to his dead listing approach it seemed that
the community begun to underestimate the live-one with our beloved SoftIce.
I'll show you the dangers such aproach still hides, since many incredible features
are tainted by the dead listing, like the one in HexWorkshop that comes
below. I wish to say here, that the live approach is at least so important
as the dead one, and that you should always check your targets using both approaches. 
Sometimes this will spare you a lot of work. </p>

<p>NOTE: for both MVP Backgammon and Bridge we could also &quot;apply&quot; the
Borland Resource Workshop approach successfully, but if you want to see how these 
targets maintain nags, I suggest you to follow me, it will not be so boring and
you'll learn something new. </p>

This is a very pretty game, although quite simple, and as the name suggest
it is a implementation of this antique amusement. The program is shareware,
not protected at all, yet with some annoying features that focus our attention:<br>
When you start the game, right after the (fully warrantable) MVP-logo,
a dialog pops up with two elements - a edit field with a quite long text
inside, disabusing us about what we should do as next, if we - undoubtfully
- like this exclusive product (we have to run immediately to the store/bank),
and a button - OK - , that we press after we've thoroughly read the explanations
above - and only now the game starts. The whole thing appears again when
you want to stop enjoying it, you must then press OK again to scratch the
backgammon from your desktop. But that is not all!<br>
After finishing the game, like a dead spirit greeting you from the other side, your very
own editor launches and presents to you a stupid Order Form, by which you
could buy this bothersome game for, believe it or not, just 40 bucks<br>
Jolly guys, this MVP Soft programmers!<br>
Since we don't like when OTHERS waste OUR resources for such a crap (and anyway 
just and solely for learning purposes) we gonna change all this. 
This time the dead approach
will be enough, but when you wish to test against side-effects, you must
use SoftIce. </p>

<p>Now you disassembled the target and we are going together to crack it.
In this example we will try to bypass the annoying pieces of code, thus
jumping over the relevant calls to this dialog and over the place where
our Editor is launched.<br>
Where should we begin?<br>
The Nag Screen is a Dialog with the title &quot;Registering MVP Backgammon&quot;.
Since dialogs are mainly created via DIALOGBOX() and CREATEDIALOG() windo$e
functions, it is a good idea to look at the imported functions of our program
to check for the above two. This is done in Wdasm when you select Imports
from the Functions menu, or simply press the ImpFn button, duh<br>
Scrolling down we see: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">..........................
USER.CREATEWINDOW
USER.DEFWINDOWPROC
USER.DESTROYCURSOR
USER.DESTROYWINDOW
USER.DIALOGBOX &lt;========================= THIS HERE!
USER.DISPATCHMESSAGE
..........................</font></pre>

<p>(there will be many more functions). <br>
When we doubleclick the DIALOGBOX item, Wdasm locates the first reference
to this function in the listing. To see the other references we just keep
doubleclicking the item.<br>
There are lots of DIALOGBOX references in the listing, it's almost impossible
to trace them all, how can we get &quot;ours&quot;?<br>
Looking at the Dialog Information in the listing (start of the disassembly)
we can see: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">+++++++++++++++++ DIALOG INFORMATION ++++++++++++++++++

.......

Name: DialogID_2382, # of Controls=002, Caption:&quot;<font color="red">Registering</font> MVP Backgammon&quot; 
  001 - ControlID:2383, Control Class:&quot;&quot; Control Text:&quot;&quot; 
  002 - ControlID:0001, Control Class:&quot;&quot; Control Text:&quot;&amp;OK&quot; 

...........</font></pre>

<p>So, now look at Dialog Reference (pressing the DLGRef button) and find
the one with the DialogID_2382. Doubleclick it for Wdasm to locate it in
our Source Code - and we are lucky: only one occurrence! </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">..................
* Possible Reference to Dialog: DialogID_2382, CONTROL_ID:2383, &quot;&quot;
  |
:0019.0FB7      688323          push 2383
:0019.0FBA      66FF36001E      push word ptr [1E00]
:0019.0FBF      9AFFFF0000      call USER.SETDLGITEMTEXT
...................</font></pre>

<p>Seems to be on the right track... Now look around - above and below
- and... just a chunk code before that: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">............
Exported fn(): REGDLGPROC(const HWND__*,uint,u,long) - Ord:0017h
:0019.0F90      8CD0    mov ax, ss
:0019.0F92      90      nop &lt;============ ?????? (see below)
:0019.0F93      45      inc bp
:0019.0F94      55      push bp
:0019.0F95      8BEC    mov bp, sp
:0019.0F97      1E      push ds
..............</font></pre>

<p>What the hell does it mean? Why should this function be exported? Is
it called from somewhere &quot;outside&quot; our program? Possible from
a perfid DLL, hiding a weird protection scheme? <br>
The answer is simple if you are familiar with windo$e programming: We just
fetched the DIALOG() procedure for the nag. A dialog procedure under windo$e
makes your dialog &quot;go round&quot;; YOU wrote it and it is kind-of-&quot;called
back&quot; from windo$e after you created the dialog; but it must not therefore
be also exported. Probably it is called from another DLL, it is up to you
if you want to proof this. <br>
How does windo$e know about which dialog procedure belongs to a dialog?
The programmer tells this. Once you are about to create a dialog you call
p.e. the Dialogbox()-windo$e procedure and one of its parameters points
to the dialog procedure you intend to use for the specific dialog... Dig
it? <br>
Now back to our listing. <br>
As we already know, this is the dialog procedure responsible for the behavior
of the nag dialog called &quot;Registering MVP Backgammon&quot; which we
are going to &quot;fix&quot;. What when we crack immediately this routine,
thus gathering from windo$e the ability to create the nag dialog? You see,
it wouldn't be a good idea, since this function does only the half of the
job on our dialog; and - notice this well! - it outcrops AFTER the dialog
has been created, NOT before this! You can try this out as I did, p.e.
change : </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">change  :0019.0F90      8CD0    mov ax, ss
to                      CB      retf </font>(also  retf 000A, if you want)</pre>

<p>and look at the mess you created... <br>
So we have to use another approach. I've already mentioned, that this
function has to be &quot;reported&quot; to the OS in order to be properly
&quot;called back&quot; when it's time for the program to deal with the
user's input. When we find the place where this happens, then we'll be
closer to the naging mechanism as well. <br>
But how can we do this?<br>
Well, there must be a pointer to this crap somewhere pushed as parameter
to the dialogbox(), createdialog() or so (see above!); and since we DO
KNOW its address -:0019.0F90 - ...click?... <br>
Now lets search! In W32dasm we simply make a Find Text with 0F90 and the
very first hit looks like this: </p>

................................</font></pre>

<p>Everyone is here! Good old W32dasm did it this time! <br>
This is almost self explained but here I'll say it again: <br>
MAKEPROCINSTANCE() with the address of our dialog procedure as parameter
is needed for system reasons, it returns a handle for the function at 0019.0F90
and this handle is passed then to the DIALOGBOX(), which on turn establishes
then the well known nag dialog. After the crime is commited FREEPROCINSTANCE()
&quot;unregisters&quot; the dialog procedure since windo$e no more needs
it. The last two calls are doing &quot;clean up&quot; jobs. <br>
Congratulations! You just have seen how 16-bit windo$e programs handle
our enemys - the nag screen dialogs. <br>
Immediatly after that this finctions rets. We don't need to bother for
the function at 0019.0F90, since it is no more relevant to the nag scheme
at all. When we crack properly the one that creates the nag, the dialog
procedure itself will never come on turn. <br>
Tracing back in the last piece of code we soon notice, that it is entered
at: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">...........
:0019.1081      8CD0    mov ax, ss
:0019.1083      90      nop &lt;===== ????????
:0019.1084      45      inc bp
:0019.1085      55      push bp
:0019.1086      8BEC    mov bp, sp
:0019.1088      1E      push ds
...........</font></pre>

<p>and after a lot of ressource-relevant calls it comes to the above DIALOGBOX()
call. There is also a retf at: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">..........
:0019.1128      1F      pop ds
:0019.1129      5D      pop bp
:0019.112A      4D      dec bp
:0019.112B      CB      retf&lt;================ HERE!
.........</font></pre>

<p>but we don't bother for it, since it is just on &quot;emergency exit&quot;
for the program in case it didn't find its resources. <br>
And don't forget what we are about to do! Let's crack! <br>
There is one radical way I know when you want to bypass a routine: Just
ret it at the very beginning. You must be sure of course that no other
use of this routine is made (but for the nag); and there is a more &quot;subtle&quot; 
detail: 
the stack's clean up (after parameters have been passed to it). Thus sometimes 
you must experiment a little, but in this case we can
try it out: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">change  :0019.1081      8CD0    mov ax, ss
to      :0019.1081      CBxx    retf (xx means don't care)</font></pre>

<p>You will need for this one of the Hexeditors we'll crack in this essay,
be aware, the right offset of the instructions is in the status bar of
W32dasm. (Don't forget the backup copy of the target victim!). <br>
So we made it, saved it and know lets see: Launch the Backgammon. Waw!
Aren't we wizards?! No more nags at the beginning, no more nags at the
end of the game. <br>
We were right. </p>

<p>A little NOP-digression: As you maybe noticed, there are some strange,
fully needless nop instructions in the code of some functions, near the
entry point. In most cases there are for alignment there, but in some old
windo$e versions they are replaced from the OS with other instructions,
thus gaining access to the privat data segments of a program. This stupid
practice is obsolet in the 32bit world and no more present but you should
learn to take hands off from patching NOPs for a very good reason, as 
+ORC always said: since they could be overwritten in some cases. </p>

<p>Now... the stupid editor remains! We have to fix this too, just for
learning purpose of course... this is not the kind of target that you crack 
because you NEED it, this is the kind of target that you crack and then 
throw away almost immediately. <br>
There is one quite popular way to start any process from your program -
when you call the WINEXEC() function. <br>
To be sure, we take a look at the Imported Functions of our backgammon
- press the button &quot;ImpFn&quot; in the toolbar. Then scroll the window
untill you reach: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">.....................

KERNEL.WINEXEC &lt;==============HERE!

.................</font></pre>

<p>Aha, WINEXEC() is there! Now doubleclick on it, Wdasm locates the reference
in its window, doubleclick once more - and we are lucky again, no more
occurances. </p>

<p>Can we do it the same manner as with the dialog? I say yes, since there
aren't any relevant system calls before WINEXEC(), the GETMODULEFILENAME
serves for ?????????????????. But when we want to be sure, as I already
said, we should have to set a breakpoint inside this code perhaps at: </p>

<p>and then we &quot;walk&quot; trough the game, wating for softice to

This is another nice product from our friends in MVP, this time a S-class
one, if you believe the home-made reclame. In addition to the already known
nags (bugs ;-) - dialog before running and quitting, this target starts your own 
editor as well, whithout
asking you, and the game is also limit protected! When you start the game,
a nice nag dialog informs you that you have a 30 days trial period or either a
20 times &quot;quiver&quot; for using it, &quot;...whatever comes last.&quot; Pretty generous
dimensioned from MVP. <br>
I did play this game just a few times and its best feature is the background
and &quot;event&quot; music it plays during the rubbers, unfortunately
it suffers from some algorithmic weakness (a common MVP feature BTW ;-)<br>
Sometimes
I used it when I was general frustrated from life - &quot;This time
I'm playing to win...&quot;. <br>
I would never have come to the idea to crack this target if not just for learning
purposes (you must pay 40 US$ to &quot;gain&quot; this game, a crap that you probably could better 
program yourself)<br>I went to work on it. Right
after the first attempt it looked somehow fishy to me, like wasting my
own resources without permissions... and I in general punish such attempts.
<br>
First -of course- I desinstalled (deleted) the game in order to install it once more
- no chance. After some I/O trapping I found a file called Clock.tim in
the windo$e directory, which is &quot;consulted&quot; by the program everytime
it starts. This was already &quot;housebreaking&quot; but after a meaningful text:
</p>

<pre>  <font COLOR="#993366">You have exceeded the playing limit!</font>... etcetera</pre>

<p>The thought that somebody leaves traces and marks on my own harddisk, without 
any warning, just to ensure
his (fully) hypothetical profit of 40 bucks is for me like a slap on my face. 
Dear MVP boys
-when you will read this- there are perhaps millions of software developers
all over the world and I'm testing <u>thousands</u> of different shareware 
applications every year.<br>Just
imagine the mess, when evryone leaves even a very tiny file inside 
MY OWN windo$e folder (32KB under Win95 minimum!) or some half-concealed keys in MY 
OWN registry!
Should I buy a new disk just to keep your (futile and pathetical) &quot;secrets&quot; inside the 
old one?
This is only one reason more to crack all your damn protections &quot;black
and blue&quot;, as the +Masters use to say. <br>
So. <br>
I began working on this when the limit was already over. It is certainly better
to start deprotecting when the target still works (a &quot;fresh&quot; target) but 
in this case is quite interesting to analize its behavior <u>after</u> that, once the 
target is already stale... and in order
to learn something new, we better work this way!<br>
To simulate the situation
you could start the game 20 times repeatedly, but since I won't harass
you with such trivial tasks here you can find a <a HREF="tppmsgs/msgs8.htm#894" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/mvpcount.zip">
mvpcount.REG</a> file, reflecting the state of the &quot;hidden&quot; counter
after 15 launches, you add it to your registry by simply clicking it twice.
Don't forget to delete the CLOCK.TIM in your Window$ directory!<br>
You need also to turn your clock one month forward. <br>
Now you can enjoy the game 5 more times until the protection snaps. When
you start the program at this point, you see just a message box as: </p>

<pre> <font COLOR="#993366">You have exceeded the playing limit.</font> 
...bla-bla-bla.....</pre>

<p>And after pressing OK comes first the nag dialog and then the editor
too. <br>
Lets disassemble the thing (Mvpbr.exe). Pressing ImpFn we then look for
our DIALOGBOX(). Surprise - we see it along with the similar one DIALOGBOXINDIRECT(),
but only at one place in the listing, one after another! This means, that
ALL dialogs in this game - and there are many! - come as parameters passed
to the function containing both dialogbox() procedures - and the DIALOGBOX()
is called at only one place, yet with different parameters for the different
dialogs. This a clever approach, since it first:<br>
- spares exports/ load time<br>
and second - and more important for us<br>
- lets us search for our dialogs on a &quot;higher&quot; level and more
difficult!<br>
What we should do?<br>
A first approach is to find where in the body of our game the message box
with the above text is issued, in the hope that we will land somewhere
in the protection scheme as well. In order to do it we can search for the
string &quot;exceeded&quot; and for references to it. And here I made a
mistake that costs me lot of time and work: I tried the Wdasm Find Text
and found nothing, while pretty easy located the word with the Hexeditor
in the Mvpbr.exe. Why?<br>
We must never forget what +ORC says:<br>
<font COLOR="#FF0000">First analize the target! How is it structured? 
 What kind of windo$e program
is it?<br>
</font>In this case it is a 16bit program with 14 different segments, as
we can see at the beginning of the disassembly: </p>

<p>Neither Find Text, nor StrRef can help us, we have to look directly
in the data segments!<br>
There are 7 of them, but only 1 contains actualy data. We can see this
by pressing the HexData button/ menu item.<br>

<p>What do you mean? The error message, followed immediately by the command
line for launching the editor! Hot!<br>
But how do we proceed further?<br>
Look, to display a message, any windo$e procedure needs a pointer to that
string passed as parameter to the procedure. And what looks a pointer like?
It is just the offset of the string within some data segment. Since we
see above that &quot;our&quot; offset is 013A, we do following search:
</p>

<p>Find Text <font COLOR="#993366">mov ax, 013A</font> (there must be ONE
space between the comma and the 013A </p>

<p>Note, that only Find Text <font COLOR="#993366">013A</font> would do
it too, but there are to much irrelevent occurences of it.<br>
Now Wdasm searches and what? Believe it or not, but there is only one mov
ax, 013A in the whole program: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">.............
:0001.07C9      3D1E00  cmp ax, 001E
:0001.07CC      7303    jnb 07D1
:0001.07CE      E98800  jmp 0859

:0001.07D1      B83A01  mov ax, 013A &lt;========== HERE!
:0001.07D4      8CDA    mov dx, ds
:0001.07D6      52      push dx
..............</font></pre>

<p>Is that what we need? we can try it! Right above the mov there is a
jump-around construction, lets change it: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">from  :0001.07CC      7303     jnb 07D1
to    :0001.07CC      7300     jnb 07CE</font></pre>

<p>thus forcing program flow to the mysteriose 0859 location.<br>
Load the mvpbr.exe in the hexeditor, go to location 000017CC (you take
it from the status line of the Wdasm!), patch it and save. Now run the
game and what? It starts with the nag set to &quot;Time expired&quot; but
no more limits there!<br>
Wasn't it easy?<br>
This is not the final crack, as there are many more checks and reefs in
our target. At this place I will explain how the protection works to see
how many things we still have to do.<br>
The file clock.tim is not so relevant for the protection. You can delete
it, but Mvpbr creates it every time anew. It serves only for comparison
with the other data.<br>
The main source for the protection is of course the registry. The program
creates a new key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT named Accessoires. Then it adds
to it a subkey Clock, which in turn contains tree subkeys: D1, D2 and T1.
These subkeys contain string values, accordingly to the following schema:
</p>

<p>D1 represents the date of the last-but-one start of the program; <br>
D2 represents the date of the very last start; <br>
T1 represents the total times you used it. </p>

<p>So even if you &quot;turn back the time&quot;, the program recognize
it and refuses starting.<br>
And now look: What happens, when you, WITHOUT any intents turn the clock
back and try the game (this happens automaticaly when you are playing late
night on the day when the or summer-winter time change commits) - you will
be never able to start normally this program again, even when in the &quot;allowed&quot;
limit!<br>
Is such protection juristic legitim at all? <br>
With this in mind we come back to cracking. Now, where the game works again,
we are going to crack first the whole protection, and then we will remove
tha nags in order to save our disk space (and for learning purpose, of
course!)<br>
We can of course simply delete the Accessoires key in the registry, or,
for more fun just copy the value of D2 into D1, but since they are created
every time anew and the registry becames more and more a carbage colector
we should try these keys to be not created at all.<br>
If you look closer at the HexData dump above, you can see three other messages
complaining some &quot;errors&quot;: </p>

<p><font COLOR="#993366">System error - conflicting dates</font>... at
offset 00A9 - this occures when the date in the Clock.tim does not correspond
to the one in the Registry; <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">System date error</font>... at offset 00F9 - when
you turn your system time back, and <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">System installation error</font>... at offset 01A8
- if the registry operation fails </p>

<p>We can easy locate the references to the strings using the same approach
as above: <br>
Find Text mov ax, String_Offset <br>
p.e. searching for <font COLOR="#993366">mov ax, 00A9</font> will find
this: </p>

<p>There is still one occurrence apiece, so you can't do anything wrong.
The locations are close to each other and everyone has a short overhead
with a jump-around chain, followed by a WINEXEC() call. This means, the
program checks everytime for the current condition, and, if &quot;not good&quot;
puts the appropriate message, otherwise it jumps to the next check.<br>
Do we need to crack ALL these checks separately in order to become our
program run without any nags? You can try it, of course, and it will work
(be aware to patch the right jump/conditional jump, it is always the FIRST
one of a chain; sometimes you should patch ALL the jumps!) but this will
be the hell of a job; furthermore our goal should be to crack it so, that
no more registry keys will be added/no files created!<br>
This is done generally by jumping over the culprite code to the location
where the &quot;really&quot; game begins. So we need TWO locations: the
first where we should jump from, and the second where we're jumping to.
<br>
How do we find them? <br>
The latter one is easy. Browsing through the code around the checks we
soon find the calls that handles the registry itself: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">.....................
:0001.0470      9AFFFF0000      call SHELL.REGQUERYVALUE

.......................

:0001.04AC      9A71040000      call SHELL.REGQUERYVALUE
.......................</font></pre>

<p><font COLOR="#000000">etc.</font> <br>
<font COLOR="#000000">Just after the LAST registry call at:</font> </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">.................
:0001.0B6F      9A79090000      call SHELL.REGCLOSEKEY

:0001.0B74      B80302          mov ax, 0203  &lt;===&lt; HERE
:0001.0B77      8CDA            mov dx, ds
...................</font></pre>

<p>we may suppose that the deverse checks are finished and is a good place
for jumping to. You can call it Zen, if you want, however I have tryed
it and it works. Jumping to it from somewhere above the checks puts one
through the &quot;back door&quot; directly in the &quot;restricted area&quot;!
<br>
Now we have our &quot;entry point&quot;. What leaves is the location, where
to place the jump itself. <br>
There are lots of registry calls in that code chunk, creating, seting,
and reading variose keys. But where exactly are the relevant keys created?
The string &quot;Accessiores&quot; doesn't appear in the disassembly or
in the HexData, nor can you find it even with a hex-search in the exe or
in the DLLs. The same with the &quot;clock.tim&quot;. <br>
Mistery?<br>
Look at this beautiful piece of code, just before the first registry-related
call: </p>

...................</font></pre>

<p>Tricky, what?<br>
You should always be aware, when you see such massive byte - constant loads
in a target! BTW, since Wdasm still missing a feature as ASCII- dump the
constant's manipulation, you can pretty easy &quot;see&quot; such hidden
string- buildings with SoftIce - one more advantage of the live approach.
<br>
We lhave to:<br>
find a place for our jump before the file is created AND<br>
calculate the offset.<br>
BTW, [bp+FCEA] is indeed [bp-0321] - have you made your homeworks?(;-P)
- but it is still not the final address of &quot;CLOCK.TIM&quot;. When
the file is about to be created it needs <b>three more</b> letters (guess
which) for the INT 21 call (yes, this target uses DOS-fashion calls to
manipulate this file!), so we have to search for [bp-31F], which looks
like [bp+FCDE] in our disassembly.<br>
We find it at : </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">...................
:0001.03A2      FFB6E0FC        push word ptr [bp+FCE0]
:0001.03A6      FFB6DEFC        push word ptr [bp+FCDE];  &lt;======= HERE!
:0001.03AA      9AD8005403      call 0007.00D8
...................</font></pre>

<p>So our location should be the 0001.03A2.<br>
There is still another problem. The program creates one more file in its
directory, called Temp.tst. It is no relevant at all and serves to check
whether the game resides on a CD or on the hard disk, but when we place
the jump on the above address, this file - automaticaly erased otherwise
- remains too.<br>
So we make a final Text Find with: <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">mov ax, 0026</font> <br>
where 0026 is the offset of the string &quot;\Temp.tst&quot; in the data
segment (DataHex!) </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">..................
:0014.0020 43 3A 00 43 3A 00 5C 54  C:.C:.\T &lt;==== HERE!
:0014.0028 45 4D 50 2E 54 53 54 00  EMP.TST.
:0014.0030 54 45 4D 50 2E 54 53 54  TEMP.TST
..................</font></pre>

<p>What comes at least is what we needed: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">............
:0001.02A9      B82600  mov ax, 0026; &lt;==== HERE COMES the JUMP!!!
:0001.02AC      8CDA    mov dx, ds
:0001.02AE      52      push dx
...........</font></pre>

<p>Now the offset.<br>
In the windo$e world most of the jumps are compiled as E9h, what is a relative
jump with a 16b offset, which means it needs 3 bytes in the binary. The
offset then is calculated as follows: <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">offset = (jump_destination - jump_address) - 3</font>
<br>
In our case: <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">offset = (0B74 - 02A9) - 3 = 08C8h</font> <br>
but it must be compiled so:<br>
<font COLOR="#993366">E9 C8 08<br>
</font>due to the weird way the Intel processors store data in memory -
the LSB (Low Significant Byte) in the lower addres, the MSB (Most Significant
Byte) in the higher. <br>
Now we can crack: Open the Mvpbr.exe in your HexEditor, go to the offset
<font COLOR="#993366">000012A9h</font> (you've seen it on the task bar
of Wdasm!) in <font COLOR="#993366">Segment 0001 </font>and </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">change:         B82600  mov ax, 0026
to:             E9C808  jmp 0B74</font></pre>

<p>We did it! <br>
As a nice side effect from this, the &quot;entry&quot; nag screen disapears
too! But the final one and the editor with the order form still remains.
You have owned already the knowledge nessessary to commit this last crack,
but there is still something I want to show you. <br>
We start as usual at the beginning of the W32Dasm listing, looking for
the dialog named &quot;Order info&quot; - this is the text presented in
the window's caption of the dialog. Here is it: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">..................

<p>This target uses enter for the procedure frame, but it doesn't realy
matter for us. Note that retf 0010 suggests, that the procedure (in this
case) have recieved 10h prameters (inclusive CS:IP!) and at its end it
makes clean-up of the stack. <br>
Now we can easy crack it by placing retf 0010 at 0002.5f92 instead of enter.
But in this case it won't work! <br>
You see, somwhere in the body of this function they set up a jump-table
for later use; when we bypass it, the program crashes when it quits! <br>
An ugly, really ugly trick! <br>
So we must look closer. The second call leads us direct to the dialog routines
- you can try it if you will, I don't want to bother you with more code
here. Relevant is the fact that we can crack the above: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">change  :0002.5FD9      FF7608  push word ptr [bp+08]
to      :0002.5FD9      E90800  jmp 5FE4</font></pre>

<p>Since the editor starts immediately after that it's a good idea to find
the place where this function is called from in the hope to eliminate the
WINEXEC() too. We do a Text Find (backwards) with call 0002.5F92 as retf
tells us that it must be a far call. What You Find is What You Needed:

This is a small and very fast (unlike the monstrose Hex Workshop) HexEditor.
Allthough with limited functionality it still offers the most important
for us features. If you have only 16MB RAM and have to deal with large
files (what I suppose you are doing!) you'll soon learn to appreciate it.
<br>
It is time limited and refuses to save changes (during the trial period)
to the files too, but is protected with a very banal scheme. I would never
bother Fravia's page with such ridiculous thing but since this essay
concentrates on the newbee's needs I'll explain this crack here as a foretaste
of what comes next. <br>
Little online-registering digression: <br>
In fact there two commonly methods to register a shareware online (I mean: 
on your computer): Choosing the option &quot;registration&quot; from somwhere
in the menus of a target you are prompted to input either a <br>
-serial number (like Hex Workshop) or <br>
-a user name, followed with the apropriate &quot;User Number&quot; - kind
of the Login/Password pairs known from Unix and other multiuser OS. <br>
The protection then checks for validity of the users input and acts depending
of whether you typed the right values or not. The chek itself uses one
of the two approaches: <br>
-It manipulates the UserName item in a more or less &quot;secret&quot;
way - this means it ENCODES it. The rezult then represents the Magic Key
which the program expects as the second input - the user number (or password,
sometimes it is just another string) - to open to you the gates of the
unlimited use. <br>
-Sometimes however the user number is encoded too - as by Gif Construnction
Set - in order to NOT let us see the right number while debugging the target.
<br>
Needless to say, that while the first approach means no protection at all,
the second is a really challenge to the cracker genius. <br>
Our Yuri software has implemented the first method ;-) <br>
Let see - load SoftIce and start the target. From the menu item Help in
Hedit we select About Hedit and a dialog box pops up with a meaningless
text and two buttons. We press the Register one and an other box presents
to us the registration form which in this case consists only of two text-edit
ields as: <br>
Name: <br>
Registration Number: <br>
I used for this example UncleVan and 123456789, but you can place your
name there. Be aware to use longer names, since some schemes require more than few 
chars for their manipulations. <br>
As number (or password) use always a string with DIFFERENT characters
in it, this can be very useful if you are about to trace some longer encoding
algorithm. <br>
As you should already know fro +ORCs lessons, they use most of the time
the GETWINDOWTEXT() function to get the user input. If you are not sure
you can try the GETDIALOGITEMTEXT() too. <br>
At this point you press Ctrl-D. The softice screen should appear. Here
you have to bpx the above function. Type first addr to see the name of
the target - Hedit in this case. Then change to its addres context with:
<br>
addr hedit <br>
This ensure that you are in the right address space to set the breakpoints.
Now type: <br>
bpx getwindowtext <br>
Press Ctrl-D again. You return to windo$e. Here you press OK in the registration
dialog. SoftIce pops up immediately, but this time we must press G to continue
executing Hedit, since this was only the UserName-read. Hedit reads first
both fields and then calculates the right number. When SoftIce pops again
you are in the very beginning if the GETWINDOWTEXT() procedure, so you
have to press F12 twice (or issue twice p ret ) to come back to Hedit,
right where the function was called: </p>

<p>Now we look for callS followed by compS or testS - like in 00427417,
but it's not him this time. We can check any suspective conditional jump
by changing to the register window in SoftIce and triggering then the appropriate
flag. <br>
I'll spare you the bothersome work. Pressing F12 repeatedly you see that
after 5 more F12s the nag window appears, telling you the number you entered
is not correct. We'll do the same once more, pressing this time 6 time
F12 after the second break due to getwindowtext. Now we are at that code,
where the nag is triggered and try to find the reason (call) for that:

<p>There are here only two calls with consecutive test and conditional
jump after that. The first is where we came from and it jumps directly
to the exit of our function. When you now trace this snippet with F10,
you'll see that the call at <font COLOR="#993366">0040223E</font> causes
the nag to display. So we have to concentrate our efforts on the second
of the suspective calls at <font COLOR="#993366">00402213</font>, since
it jumps around the nag and looks more likely to hide the encoding scheme.
<br>
We now set a breakpoint at its address and run once more the registration
procedure. When SoftIce stops at 00402213 we press F8 and trace into it.
And Bingo! We are in the middle of something that looks very like a encoding
routine: </p>

<p>We see here the &quot;heart&quot; of the scheme. The code between my
comments is executed 100h(!) times (256 dec), calculating in this stupid
manner your &quot;magic&quot; number. We can set a breakpoint on <font COLOR="#993366">004039EB</font>,
thus let the processor do this job. Since right after the encoding something
is placed in EAX, we &quot;ask&quot; SoftIce: <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">? eax</font> <br>
and SoftIce responds with: <br>
<font COLOR="#993366">02021810 33691664 &quot; &quot;</font> <br>
The first is the hex value in eax, and can you guess what the second is?
Yes, this is our User Number as decimal! It wasn't heavy, don't you mean?

This is a Visual Basic target. I never use VB programs but since I've read
various essays about this I decided to proof whether the common approach
with SoftIce and/or W32dasm is applicable on such targets too and I was
pretty suprised. I think, that we don't need very special tools or methods
to crack the visual tools; a good, solid basic cracking experience should
be enough. <br>
My assumption was, that unlike comon tasks - like registering windows, reading
user input etcetera - a protection can NOT delegate its basic deal - the
decision right number/bad number - to the OS or some run time DLL; it must
make this decision inside its OWN code, and perform the necessary &quot;preparations&quot; 
for displaying nags or so inside its OWN body too. <br>
But lets look at these problems one after another. <br>
This icon editor is shareware and has a nag screen with countdown - before
starting and quitting... you must wait at least 10 sec. as if it was not enough for
waiting till this monster loads in memory. The author provides an online
registration option too, which we are now gonna crack. <br>
I first disassembled the exe, but the listing looks very disappointing,
unless you feel convinient with something like this: </p>

<p>Really ugly, if you'r not a VB-buff eh? And micro$oft propagates this as up-to-date
programming environment! Poor people those who believe it! Now we'll see how
easy it is to crack all this... like it weren't protected at all. <br>
In this case we have to export the M$VBVM50.DLL to SoftIce, else we can never
land in the body of our target; the registration form is implemented as
a thread - a very clever boy, that Hagen Wieshofer, but he has no chance with
his VBv5!<br>We add the DLL to the exported symbols in the Symbol Loader,
then - the same procedure as last time - Load SoftIce, launch the target,
select Help-Enter-Registration and type as User Name whatever you want and
as Registration Number 1234567890 again. For me the name was UncleVan.
<br>
Man, it's a hell of varios functions! Some have pretty easy names, other
are totaly cryptic: </p>

<p>Where should we begin? <br>
Well, even without any VisualBasic experience I &quot;feel&quot; the MSVBVM50.rtcMsgBox 
as the most meaningful among them.
Since a message--box complains to us that the code was wrong, we bpx it:
</p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">:addr iconedit
:bpx rtcmsgbox
:g</font></pre>

<p>Now Ctrl-D again and back in the Icon Editor we press OK in the registration
form as usual. SoftIce pops up at the beginning of the rtcMsgBox: <br>
By pressing F11 we see th emessage-box itself and clicking on OK we land
directly into the body of iconedit, right after the call was issued: <br>
As we are interested in how the program came there we scroll up and look
observing at the code above. The only jump OVER the message box procedure
is at: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">...............
0137:00495A27   E9FE000000      JMP 00495B2A ; &lt;== Jumps OVER the message box

<p>and it is on unconditional jump; that means for the instruction at 00495A2C
to recieve control MUST be referenced from somewhere else. <br>
Let search for a jump to it. There is indeed only one, quite above this
code and right after a suspective construction with the following &quot;strange&quot;

<p>Interesting, isn't it? Now it is important to know, that all Fxxx instructions
deal with the FPU, the arithmetic coprocesor. At this point you must turn
on the FPU window in SoftIce, if you have never done that before, learn it now: It's 
a pretty useful cracking feature!<br>The 
command for this is WF.<br>Once you have done it, you will see something 
like this the following below the register window:
</p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">ST0     empty           ST4     empty
ST1     empty           ST5     empty
.........
ST3     empty           ST7     empty</font></pre>

<p>These are the eight FPU registers. You can also change the format of
the numbers shown (read in the manuals - good old SoftIce has everything!)
but now this is not necessary. We bpx on the first FLD instruction and
do once more the whole registration procedure. On the FLD we press F10
to step trough the program. This right loads the ST0 register with our
number: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">ST0     1234567890.</font></pre>

<p>The next FLD shifts our number in ST1 and (stack-alike) loads another
number in ST0: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">ST0     127323. 
ST1     1234567890.</font></pre>

<p>Beautefull, isn't it? Then a FCOMP and the decision is made.... And
we can see the right number, no need to calculate it or so. Poor VB people!
This guy tried to conceal its secrets (consciously or not) as float reals,
but Visual Basic lets him fall down... He deserved his sad fate! <br>
Needles to say, the registration information is stored in a file named
ieui.dat (!) in the system directory. <br>

<i>A weak protection is even worse then no protection at all!</i> <br>
Yes, I've read Fravia's &quot;Most stupid protection award&quot; and Hex
Workshop is already mentioned there. I'll qoute here Aesculapius from his
essay: </p>

<pre><font COLOR="#993366">.......
         ; Lady's and gentleman we're inside the
         ; protection scheme itself... and we
         ; found TWO calls... that means that
         ; the valid serial is calculated two
         ; times, how touching, probably, the
         ; first one when application starts
         ; and the other when the user tries
         ; to register it. 
.............</font></pre>

<p>Aesculapius was (for once) wrong. The validation of the serial is made 
ONLY ONCE, when you
enter it, this gives us the possibility to register it with ANY number you
like, and this without any need for cracking or patching it, only with
our beloved SoftIce! <br>
Lets start from the beginning. <br>
As we already know, this target needs a &quot;valid&quot; serial number
in order to let one type in his name and organisation (!). Then it generates
a .reg file, where: <br>
-serial number <br>
-user name.. <br>
-..and eventualy organisation <br>
are placed, but &quot;embeded&quot; in a very special way and encoded with
the additional data there. On start it checks out the .reg file, but due
to the nature of this protection it proofs only the consistence of the
data there (whether the file is properly encoded or not), and not the serial
itself. <br>
Probably BPSoft lets this way a open door for future serial's changes,
dividing therefore the protection in two independent parts - one for the
serial, and another for the encoding, which works separately from the first
part. <br>
You understand now the approach: If we would be able to fool the algorithm
making it think that the RIGHT serial was entered, it then would generate
the RIGHT .reg file for us, even with a wrong number! <br>
And there is really a way to do this! <br>
Now start as usual: Choose help-about-register, type 1234567890 or whatever combination 
you want to have as serial, Ctrl-D, bpx GETWINDOWTEXT(), Ctrl-D again and
then OK in the form. Now F12 until you see the message box with the nag
- that means 6 times. This code is VERY similar to the one of Hedit, I'm
wondering if both are derivates from a common source, and which one it could be... &quot;software 
collation, may be we should learn these techniques ;-)<br>
Now repeat the whole once more and this
time press F12 only FIVE times, lets look now closer. I have made it for
you this time: </p>

<p>The one at 0137:004262AF triggers the &quot;bad&quot; jump. <br>

<p>The idea is to re-jump it, in order to make the algorithm to &quot;believe&quot;
that we have entered the right serial. <br>
We switch for this to the register window - with the mouse, or if you don't
have a Pentium processor press Alt-R. Now we place the caret over the Z
flag - since it causes the jump - and switch it to z with the Insert key,
thus forcing the program to &quot;not jump&quot;. When we change back to
the command window (WC) the text on the current instruction changes to
&quot;no jump&quot;. Now GO - and a second form appears inviting us to
enter User Name and Organization. <br>
There is no return at this point for the poor stupid protection scheme,
it accepts everything and after we are ready, we become registered users
with a properly encoded (with the fake serial) .REG file in Hex Workshop's
directory. <br>
Isn't cracking great? Even better than playing bridge or chess!<br>
I have made it months ago on the 2.52 version and in the latest 2.54 version
it still works. I hope the next few versions will NOT have this same stupid 
protection... I'm getting bored...
<br>
But if you now think that this is a unique case of stupidity you should see the
protection of Win-eXpose I/O for Win95 - a very usefull tool BTW; you should
try it - it has exactly the same scheme! Just BPX on 00461D9, after you filled
out the registration form with your data and any serial:</p>

<pre><font COLOR="#B22222">:004061D7 85C0                    test eax, eax
:004061D9 0F84CF000000            je 004062AE; &lt;======= HERE!</font>
</pre>

<p>change then the Zero flag in the registers window and GO. The program
generates the right key for you and writes it down (with the other data)
in its .ini file. BTW, you can find the right password for your fake serial
when you BPX on 004061B2 and issue:<br>
<br>
<font COLOR="#B22222">d eax<br>
<br>
</font>You should see then in the data window the correct password for
the serial you entered terminated with a zero byte; ignore case. <br>
<b>On both programs you don't need to patch anything!<br>
</b>The competition on Fravia's Most Stupid Protection Award becomes harder
and harder ;-) <br>

Well, a pretty easy scheme, it is really a ten minute crack, but the encoding
algorithm is great. There is no way to see or even guess the right keyword
at all. If there were an award for encoding passwords GifCon would be a 
major pretender. <br>
We do it as usual: From the main window select SETUP, put your User Name
there (must be at least 6 characters long!) then press the ACCEPT button.
In the second dialog window enter some &quot;key word&quot;, for now it
is not relevant which exactly. It is the moment for entering SoftIce and
setting a breakpoint at GETWINDOWTEXT(). Then press OK in the dialog and
after two F12's SoftIce pops you here: </p>

to      0137:004097FC  EB 00  JMP 004097FE</font></pre>

<p>And the crack is commited! <br>
But we want more. We want to register with the right keyword that corresponds
to our user name. Since it is really a very complex algorithm, I've commented
it for you and explain briefly the main idea. <br>
GifCon manipulates first the user name. It uses <i>four</i> different algorithmes
for each character in a <i>four-char-cycle</i>. The result is accumulated
in ESI. After each char has been proceeded the final score is divided by
1Ch (28 dec). The remainder from this division is then multiplied by 16
(SHL 04) and this is what I called our &quot;Magic Offset&quot;. With this offset the
program then addresses a doubleword inside a table in its own data area
(in the exe!). The value of this doubleword -at least- is our real Magic Number.
<br>
And now comes the tricky part. <br>
The keyword we entered is encoded with the same algorithm, just without
the division and multiplication at the end. The final value from the encoded
keyword must then match the Magic Number from the table in the exe. <br>
So we never have the chance to see the right keyword, the comparision allways
operates with the encoded strings! For me, it is much like p.e. UNIX stores
logins and passwords, therefore I speak for password- instead of key-generator.
The program uses further another table (hardcoded in its exe too) in order
to &quot;filter&quot; the input; so you can p.e. mix your (right) keyword
with as many digits or country specific characters as you like - they are
ignored by the encoder; upper case is converted to lower in the User Name
etc. The advantage of such approach is, that even peoples with the same
name may have different keywords. <br>
Because of the complexity of all this I have included the full commented
disassebmly among all other things in a extra file which you can download
separately - <a HREF="tppmsgs/msgs8.htm#899" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/uvcrack.zip">uvcrack.zip</a>. You can find there
the password generator with source code, and both tables from the body
of the Gifcon32.exe as well. <br>
My first idea was simply to copy the encoding routine in my cracker.exe,
a kind of &quot;with his stowns over his own head&quot; - maybe someone
help me to find the right idiom ;-), and it was such a hell of a job, that
once I've adjusted everything I never came back again to improve it, so
please bear with me! <br>
It implements a simle word generator which just generates all possibly
words, beginning with &quot;aaaa&quot; (but you can change the initials);
for each of them it then calculates the Magic Number and compares it with
the one that came out from the table when encoding your User Name. And
so on until they match.<br>
It works reliably -though terribly slow- but this is because it tries every
possible word. Since every char has its own &quot;weight&quot;, depending
on its ordinal number in the string, with an algorithm that accepts a criteria
too - such as General Backtracing - one could achieve better run times.
<br>
You can try to reverse the encoding algorithm itself too, thus obtaining
the password right from the magic number, if possible at all. Feel free
to change everything you like, don't forget to paste both tables after
each compilation at the appropriate locations (look for the initial strings).<br>
Of course, you have to adjust the Makefile too.<br>
I just wanted to show that such idiotic approach can work. I had no problems
with the latest version of Gifcon 32 bit. When you experience any problems
let me know, this will be the sign that the algorithm (or one of its parameters)
has changed. But the fate even of the most stupid protection is to remain
the same, or the shareware can't be accepted by the customer anymore! <br>
<br>
That was all for now folks. Hope you enjoied this. <br>
