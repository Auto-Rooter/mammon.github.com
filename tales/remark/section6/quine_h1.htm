<tr><td></td><td><i><center>Spectacular essay. 
I'm republishing it after having read it three times. Among many other things you'll find here a lesson 
about zip cracking techniques... but that's only an example: you wont believe <u>how 
many</u> hints you'll find inside this essay. Here an 'appetizer' for 
you:</i></center><prE><font color=purple>A regular breakpoint won't fire because they've re-routed 
the interrupt.  No problem.  This has always seemed more of 
a minor nuisance than anything else because all you have to 
do is set a debug <u>register</u> breakpoint.  
So, 'bpmb CallHasp x' does the trick.  The x indicates that 
it will break if the execution reaches that address.  
In other words, it's functionally equivalent to a regular 
bpx, but invisible to any anti-SoftICE tricks.  
Of course, you only get four debug register bps at a time, 
but I've always found that to be plenty.</fonT></prE><i><center>I'm not going to comment this essay: 
Quine is a Master Cracker, and this essay is far more than advanced, 
it's <u>expert stuff</u>. I have not only learned a lot myself (this I do every time 
I get a good essay from all +friends) but I have learned things I did not ever suppose!<br>For sure I understand now the 
curiosity that +ORC himself has repeatedly manifested for Quine (after having read Quine's first essay on 
IDA +he ordered me to pass him at once all 
emails from Quine).<br>This is definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS! You better leave 
this alone if you're not an <u>advanced</u> cracker yourself 
(or a very 'steady' beginner cracker, prepared to invest A LOT of time and 
fatigue on your 
own advancing)... anyway, whoever you are... you better read (and 
follow) this essay <u>MORE</u> than a couple of times, believe me it is worth any 
minute you'll invest on it: you'll gain a WEALTH of incredible 
information!<br>My respects and 
unconditional admiration to +Quine!

An overly long and long overdue essay about how to break the 'envelope'
PE encryption scheme used by HASP dongles.  May be of general interest for
cracking code encryption routines (which seem to be all the rage now).<br>
Oh, and I put a code snippets section at the end of the article with links to it
throughout.

    I'm a fan of good digital audio software.  SoundForge is a nice example of such
software, but it's been cracked black and blue.  However, SoundForge takes plugins
and there are some great plugins for it out there, most notably, those made by the
waves corporation under the name Native Power Pack.  The folks at waves have a demo
version on their web site, but they also have an update to version 2.3.  I thought
I'd get the update and see how hard it would be to make it work.  This was done as a
casual thing.  Little did I know what would come of it.
</p><p>
    Well, the interesting thing here is that we're not actually going to crack this
target.  It would be very time consuming, it turns out, without the dongle
(and what I hope to
show in this essay is that there is a lot more cracking that can be done without a
dongle than people think).  The dongle used by waves is a HASP dongle (a MemoHASP in
particular) and I recommend taking a look at <a
href="zaferdon.htm" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/zaferdon.htm">the essay by zafer</a> on these dongles as well
as getting some info from HASP's ftp site, which I'll explain in a moment.  Rather
than cracking this target, we're going to learn a lot about how HASP implements
various aspects of their protection scheme and how, in particular, to break their
envelope protection scheme, which is a full blown exe encryptor for Win32 that relies
on the dongle for the decryption codes.  The accomplishment of this essay will
ultimately be a decryptor that works for *most* envelope protected files.  The target
itself, Native Power Pack (NPP), has already been cracked by one of those "warez"
groups that call themselves Radium.  They have done a good job, but they had the
dongle (that takes away all of the fun....).  However, having their crack enabled me
to verify some hypotheses that otherwise would have been quite tedious to test.  In
no way have I copied their crack nor has it really even been relevant to what I'm
doing here.  The only thing I benefitted from in having their version was the ability
to compare the encrypted code with the unecrypted code to see if I was getting it
right.  I'll point out where this happens along the way (actually, reading over this,
I realize that I won't, but you can figure it out).  If you're looking for Radium's
version, well, don't ask me (or fravia+) but it's not that hard to find.

    I think that takes care of the preliminaries, so let's start cracking.  The NPP
update is an InstallShield packaged for the web file.  Running it you either get the
message that you don't have the dongle installed or that you don't have the dongle
drivers installed (you should download the drivers from waves' site and install
them).  Getting the installation to run successfully is not that hard and involves
techniques that have been discussed extensively on this site, so I'll be brief.  The
trick is to find where the message box with the bad guy message comes from.  One
might guess that it's in the InstallShield script file, setup.ins  (on this topic see
<a href="natz-1.htm" tppabs="http://ftp.fravia.org/natz-1.htm">the absolutely spectacular essay by
natzgul</a> on decompiling InstallShield scripts), but a quick search through that
file doesn't turn up anything....

...That ought to do it.  Now the moment of truth.  Double-click on your newly
patched w32hinst.exe.  It works.  That's it.<br><br>
(of course, there's not much you can do with it - you don't have a hasp)

<p>
    Well, Waves Native Power Pack would take a long time to crack without the dongle,
but this may have just been dumb luck on their part.  On the other hand, I got a lot
farther cracking dongle protection without having the dongle than I thought possible.
That was all I wanted anyway.  I should mention now that there is still more work to
be done with hasp envelope protection.  I have not even looked at version 5 yet.
Perhaps they have increased the length of the key, but I doubt it.  Furthermore, it
is not absolutely essential that the target link hasp32b.obj.  It is possible,
although my guess is that it would take a couple of weeks, to determine the key by
hand.  Between the highly predictable nature of the relocation table, the function
names in the import table, the library routines and the fact that the code has to
make sense, it would not be too hard (just very time consuming) to reconstruct the
key.  I suppose it's up to you to decide whether this is worth it.  Also, there are
three more functions called after the decryption is complete.  These deal with fixing
the relocation table (this is not necessary if you patch the PE header appropriately)
and inserting dongle checks at appropriate places (again, my method wipes these out
altogether) among other things.  The only thing that's holding me back is that I'm
having a hard time getting ahold of any other envelope protected programs.  I fanyone
knows where to get any on the web, please let me know.  I'm dying to see how well the
decryptor works.  Only one test target is not enough.

I have
been reading about encryption (I realized that I really ought to know something about
it) and have discovered that both hasp and +RCG make a well known mistake in their
encryption schemes:  they repeatedly use an xor key.  An encryption scheme along
+RCG's lines which did not make this mistake and which manually did the necessary
relocations would be crackable in only two ways:<br>
<bR>
1.  find the key  (basically impossible)<br>
2.  reconstruct the code of the function (much more interesting and more possible,
but still very tough as long as a non-trivial function is discovered).<br>
<br>
I hope to have an essay about this soon demonstrating how this sort of protection can
be done in a high-level language (C/C++) without using VxDs (which I disapprove of
for reasons I will give in the essay -- for one thing they don't work in NT) and in
such a way that it would possible to create a generic method for applying the
protection.  The software author wouldn't have to even understand the protection
method.  It could be packaged up a la TimeLock, etc.</i><bR>
