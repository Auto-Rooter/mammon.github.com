The cyborg cracking manual
This started it all for me. I stumbled across the cyborg's stuff on Silicon 
Toad's page; in these days most of the cracking stuff was still on BBS boards
and uuencoded in newsgroup postings. At the time I was stuck with an old 8086, 
sans periperhals, and my access to web pages was all through work [Delrina and
CServer].

I knew asm from Ludwig's books, and it was through pursuing virii that I came 
across cracking texts.
