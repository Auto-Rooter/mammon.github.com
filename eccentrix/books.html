<i>The Silent Cry</i>, Kenzaburo Oe
<p>
This novel is a slow but ultimately rewarding read, chronicling the conflict
between two brothers in a small Japanese town with a history of strife between
its Japanese and Korean inhabitants. The book opens with the internal drama of 
the older brother; the story itself is slow to start, and inexporably follows 
the historical events that influenced the brothers. The underlying theme is 
one of perpetual struggle: modernity against tradition, youthless enthusiasm 
against mature cynicism, loyalty against rebellion, locals against outsiders, 
brother against brother.

<i>Dictionary of the Khazars</i>, Milorad Pavic
<p>
Not a typical novel. This book is split into three parts: an encyclopedia of
persons and events of significance to the Khazar culture in Christian, Islamic,
and Hebrew versions. The entries overlap and are often contradictory; there are
suitable forewards and appendices to make for a convincing read. The book is
to be read haphazardly, by picking an entry at random and following all
references from that entry, until eventually all entries are read. This makes
it easy to read [short, digestible chunks] and a bit fun as well. The 'two
versions' of this book [male and female] is just a ploy; the differing passage
can be read in a book shop in 5 minutes, and while it changes significantly
the nature of the murder trial in Appendix II, it is not something to torment
yourself over. This is a good book to read, though obviously not for everyone;
the juxtaposition of the different entries for the same historical figure or
event closely mirrors the unreliability of real-world historical and
cultural documents.

<i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>, Louis-Ferdinand Celine
<p>
The semi-autobiographical account of a man's experiences in France during
World War I, Africa and American in the 20s, and his return to France to
practice medicine. An excellent novel from one of Bukowski's self-acknowledged
major influences: this is undeniably a book that laid the foundation for
modern literature. The sketches of characters are quick, impressionistic, 
often simplified to the point of caricature. The writing is terse but vivid,
communicating as much through tone and metaphor as through description. The
main character, Bardamu, is critical of war, the government, society, and
generally everything he encounters; he is a failure at everything he attempts,
and his tales of desperate struggle to make a living are particularly 
appropriate during times of rampant unemployment [like now].
<p><br>


<i>69 Things to do with a Dead Princess</i>, Stewart Home
<p>
An enjoyable read of the sexual-logical style pioneered by deSade: lots
of pr0n cut with literary theory, set upon a backdrop of Scottish stone 
circles. The Marx quote on the flyleaf sets the tone for the novel, and teams
up with the final paragraph in providing the author's justification for the
work. A healthy dose of footnotes that must be read in-place and a prescribed
technique for reading sections in random order will probably deter the casual 
reader. The anti-bourgeois commentary on a suitably eclectic selection of 
literature is interesting, but suffers --perhaps intentionally-- from 
appearing reactionary, since few viable alternatives to the criticized works 
are provided. This commentary is of course accompanied by the typical
blind arrogance of the post-modern, and of even more typical Scottish
provincialism along the lines of "if it ain't Scottish it's crap"; the
effect is of unemployed hacks, living with their mothers while spending their
waking hours forcing uberintellectual discussions upon unsuspecting souls at
the local cafes and pubs. Overlooking this rather necessary flaw considering
the style and the subject matter, the book is quite enjoyable; there is an
admirable tendency to incorporate literary techniques that were condemned a
mere twenty pages earlier, and tests of the reader's attentiveness that add
a playful element to what could have been an overly serious book.

<i>Remix</i>, John Courtnay Grimwood
<p>
Proof that cyberpunk has lost its teeth. This one has it all, the whole canon
of cyberpunk cliches brought out and paraded before you to demonstrate that
yes, Grimwood knows what cyberpunk entails and that no, he is not prepared to
a good job of carrying the torch. There's the gratuitous name-dropping of 
anticipated corporate mergers. There's the choppy slang that begs to be 
considered authentic. There's the omnipresent soy and sushi fusion foods. 
There's the drug-artists, the bestial mutant, the ceramic, the cultists,
the razor blades, the demolition of political institutions... all of it. 
Cyberpunk is a steam roller, and this book is a long, slow, painful
ride beneath it.
<p><br>

<i>Pashazade</i>, John Courtnay Grimwood
<p>
This one was done fairly well: the main character is somewhat cliched but
remains interesting regardless; the middle-eastern flair has more consistency
than the scenarios of Grimwood's other novels. An enjoyable read, though once
again, this book is consciously cyberpunk.
<p><br>

<i>Effendi</i>, John Courtnay Grimwood
<p>
The pointless followup to <i>Pashazade</i>. Like many an author, Grimwood
cannot rest with having told a decent story or having created an interesting
character. Watching authors write sequels is like watching Screamin' Jay
Hawkins release yet <i>another</i> rewrite of his only hit, "I Put A Spell
On You", in a lamentable attempt to hit another home run with the same formula.
<p><br>

<i>Witpunk</i>, Claude Lalumiere and Marty Halpern
<p>
Don't. Just don't. One or two of the opening stories are quite good, and
there may be another two in the collection that you won't regret reading.
Most are bad: painfully bad. The science fiction is sub-par, the 'punk' has
no edge, and the humor is banal at best. Think of American sitcom writers
[<i>Friends</i>, <i>Seinfeld</i>, whatever pap offends you the most] with the
stunted "philosophy" of Kurt Cobain trying to do science fiction in the mode of
<i>Amazing Stories</i> or <i>Tales from the Crypt</i>. Uninspired, to say the 
least. The collection is all the more unforgiveable since <i>Semiotext(e) SF</i>
achieved the same goals as this collection years earlier, with a few of the
same authors.
<p><br> 


<i>Word Made Flesh</i>, Jack O'Connell
<p>
Good ideas, written in a sophmoric voice. O'Connell's proposition that
language creates reality, and that reality is limited to what can be conveyed
via human language, would be more compelling if his writing was not quite so
amateurish. A novel that should have been written by Borges or Pamuk has the
feel of Hollywood script-writing to it -- complete with the inevitable 
character cliches and predictable events. As with Grimwood mentioned earlier,
O'Connell seems to have read up on the ingredients that make a successful
metaphysical thriller ... and then used all of them, over and over, 
larger-than-life character following mythic story following secret life 
following legendary origin. What starts off as an interesting but crude story
ends up being an excruciating tour of characters and buildings with 
interesting if not profound histories, all related in loving detail yet 
apropos of nothing. The character cannot just get a cup of coffee; the 
character gets a cup of coffee at a diner that houses the last of the 
independent cabbies, is infused with an up-and-coming religious cult, and
whose opportunistic owner is a Yakuza dropout. If you also have a weariness
when it comes to authors trying to impress you with the inventiveness of
the worlds they have created, and perhaps a pet peeve for coming across
Yiddish words like "schlemiel" in third-person narrative [it was bad enough
when Harlan Ellison started doing it], this book will prove insufferable.
Otherwise, take it for what it is: a far better-than-average thriller/suspense
novel.
<p><br> 



<i>My Name Is Red</i>, Orhan Pamuk
<p>
This book is undoubtedly going to be compared to <i>Name of the Rose</i> 
because 1) it is set in 1591, 2) it is about murders surrounding an
illuminated manuscript, and 3) it is very good. This book is as similar to
<i>Name of the Rose</i> as it is to <i>Notes of a Dirty Old Man</i>, but that
just serves to show how small-minded the reviewers were. Make no mistake:
<i>My Name Is Red</i> is an excellent book. Orhan Paumk, after this and
<i>Black Book</i>, is on his way to becoming one of my favorite authors. The
story is simple: a group of illustrators are illuminating a manuscript
comissioned by the Sultan, and one after the other they are being murdered. 
An illustrator is brought in to track down the murderer while working on the 
manuscript. The story is told from an incredible number of perspectives: the 
detective, the murderer, the illustrators, the corpse, the illustrations 
themselves, and the other individuals involved in the crime. This allows 
Pamuk to explore the motivations of the characters, and to expose their 
intrigue and duplicity without interrupting the mystery. The murderer, in one 
of the passages, addresses the reader directly with a "bet you haven't 
guessed which of the others I am" taunt. All in all, quite enjoyable.
<p><br>


<i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>, Chuck Barris
<p>
How can one go wrong mixing the Cold War with The Gong Show? Chuck Barris is
recruited into the CIA while coming up with gaame show ideas for television
studios. He invents the Dating Game, the Newlywed game, and a few failed
'Game' spinoffs before hitting it on the head with the Gong Show. In the
meantime he is travelling to Europe to kill Soviet spies in ways so lucky
and bungling that they may actually be true -- the 'job' attempts read like
G. Gordon Liddy's book, only without the heavy tone of blind patriotism. Barris
manages to probe the psyche of the television audience for his shows, as well
as those who criticize them, and is consistently entertaining throughout.
<p><br> 


<i>The Demolished Man</i>, Alfred Bester
<p>
Who can commit a murder in a society policed by telepaths? Reich can! A
classic SF novel pitting a powerful man against his society. Great stuff
for the cult of the individual, and as is usual for Bester, some solid
science fiction as well.
<p><br>


<i>The X President</i>, Phillip Baruth
<p>
This is a book about Bill Clinton -- sorry, 'BC', as the book calls him in
order to avoid potential litigation. In 2055 the US is losing a war with
China -- not over a spy plane, but over tobacco industry regulation passed
by BC in the 90s. Luckily, by 2055 they have invented time travel, and the
foremost historian on BC is sent into the 90s, then the 50s, with some
marines in order to set things straight. Very entertaining, though light,
reading fare. There are some clever points regarding time travel and BC's
presidency; and though the novel does not really claim success for the mission,
the fact that the 'past' events they seek to prevent have never actually
happened makes for an amusing conclusion.
<p><br>


<i>BlackBox</i>, Nick Walker
<p>
The story of the individuals involved in the death of a stowaway on a flight
from China to England, told in 841 snippets. Not a very notable book,
though fun to read and with a few compelling minor characters -- most notably a
delusional ex-fireman whose malpracticing therapist has convinced him that
his internal organs have been switched with Frank Sinatra.
<p><br>


<i>The Hippopotamus</i>, Stephen Fry
<p>
I was curious whether Stephen Fry's comedic delivery would translate as well
into prose; I was not disappointed. This book is a combination of first-person
narrative, third-person history, and communiques between the characters. It
involves a boozing writer and critic commisioned to investigate paranormal
happenings under the guise of writing a biography. The story itself is
inventive and fun, with a healthy touch of irreverence, and Fry combines
well-crafted writing with his well-honed wit to great effect. 
<p><br>


<i>Jennifer Government</i>, Max Barry
<p>
Undoubtedly the best book I have read in a long while. Sure, it is not a
classic of literature, and is most likely to be lumped with 'slacker fiction'
and discarded by most. <i>Jennifer Government</i> is satire, a tale of ambition
gone wrong in a near-future setting that is a suitable replacement for the
done-to-death cyberpunk world. The world has gone corporate: the government
is now a not-for-profit organization that must secure funding before it can
act, and the average Joe takes the last name of his employer to show his
rank and his loyalty. Violence is subcontracted from the police and the army
to the NRA. Gun battles erupt between rival fast-food chains, and gangs wear
corporate logos for colors. Plausible? Nah...
<p><br>


<i>The Dark Fields</i>, Alan Glynn
<p>
Imagine a drug that makes you smarter. You are focussed, more productive,
you sleep less, and make intuitive leaps that have eluded men for centuries.
In a week you have written two books, mastered a musical instrument,
patented three inventions, and made it rich on the stock market. The 
drawback: the drug failed FDA testing, is being sold as a street drug, and
has a 75% fatality rate. <i>Dark Fields</i> is a compelling book, and hard
to put down. The main character changes from an unmotivated slacker to
an overachiever with random violent episodes to a paranoid recluse in the
course of his exposure to the drug, bringing memories of <i>Pi</i> and
<i>American Psycho</i> at various points in the story. Told in first person,
the book charts the changes of the character's psyche without actually
explaining them other than as "effects of the drug", while at the same time
making it obvious that the side effects are as much related to sleep
deprivation, malnutrition, and withdrawal as they are to any psychological
effect of the drug. Nicely done.
<p><br>



<i>Balthazar's Odyssey</i>, Amin Maalouf
<p>
Another novel that, set in 1665 and involving religion and a book, has been
compared to <i>Name of the Rose</i> by those who have done no more than read
the jacket cover. Of Eco's works, this is more like <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i>
than <i>Name of the Rose</i>, though the story has less of the paranoid 
metaphysics
and more globe-trotting book hunt ala <i>Ninth Gate</i>. The main character,
Cellini, is a naive and pompous merchant who becomes obsessed with a book
of end-of-the-world prophecies, and sets out in search of it. In the course
of his quest he is lied to, imprisoned, beaten, and generally made a fool of.
Do not take travel advice from this man. The reader will find this an
entertaining story told by a somewhat less than truthful narrator, who tends
to exagerrate his own heroism and worth.
<p><br>


<i>Riot</i>, Shashi Tharoor
<p>
Billed by incompetent reviewers as "an Indian <i>Rashomon</i>", when they
perhaps mean <i>In The Grove</i>. An American girl voulnteering at a 
women's rights center in India ends up dead after a Hindu/Muslim riot. She is
listed as a casualty of the riot; her parents go to India to investigate.
The book is well-crafted and interesting, though not from a "who killed her"
perspective. The identity of the murder becomes moot after reading the 
journals and narratives of the characters involved, where it becomes painfully
obvious that the girl is going to become a casualty in a conflict of
cultures.
<p><br>


<i>Samarkand</i>, Amin Maalouf
<p>
The tale of Omar Khayyam's manuscript for his book of quatrains, the 
<i>Rubaiyaat</i>. This book begins with the arrival of Omar in Samarkand in
1072, and his subsequent involvement with court intrigue: the tale of Khayaam,
Nizam al Mulk, and Hassan Sabbah comprises half of the novel and is excellent.
The second half chronicles the adventures of an American tracking down the
manuscript of the <i>Rubaiyaat</i> after learning that it was not lost in 
the siege on the Assassins' fortress. The American covers much of the same
territory as Khayyam in his quest, and ends up getting involved in the 
intrigues and battles of the Middle East. He decides to hide tha manuscript
in the safest, most secure place on earth: the Titanic. Needless to say, the 
book ends somewhere around there.
<p><br>

<i>How Late it Was, How Late</i>, James Kellerman
<p>
Quite good! I was a little wary at first, written as it is in first person
with a thick Scottish accent. The main character is a small-time
thug, in and out of prison for shoplifting, assault, robbery, and so forth.
He comes to on the first page of the book with no memory of the weekend, how
he got where he is, or where his shoes are [sound familiar?]. After a fight
he winds up back in prison, is interrogated about events that happened while
he was drunk, and ends up losing his sight after a beating. Throughout the book
he tries to evade the police, handle being blind, and track down his girlfriend
who disappeared sometime while he was drunk. The main character is the perfect
unreliable narrator, and at times makes you wonder whether in fact he did
black out, whether he is only pretending to be blind, and if he is as small-
time as he and the police seem to think. The only complaint I would have is
that the book does not actually resolve any of these issues with any finality,
but in the end that serves to make the book more enjoyable.
<p><br>

<i>Crystal Express</i>, Bruce Sterling
<p>

<p><br>

<i>Seven Japanese Tales</i>, Junichiro Tanizaki
<p>
A collection of [seven] short stories by the author of <i>Diary of a 
Mad Old Man</i>. These range from historical tales ["A Portrait of
Shunkin", "A Blind Man's Tale"] to neuroses in modern Japan ["Terror", 
"Aguri", "The Thief"] to a mildly disturbing oedipal account ["The 
Bridge of Dreams"]. Tanizaki is a master at plumbing the depths of the
human psyche, to the point where his stories cannot be taken lightly;
the vague flicker of ideas later fleshed out in Japanese cinema [and
some twisted anime] is apparent in many of these tales.
<p><br>

<i>I Sweep the Sun Off Rooftops</i>, Hana al-Shaykh
<p>
This book of short stories has quite a "chick flick" feel; expect
to see it on Oprah's reading list soon. The stories are about women
in bad marriages, women faced with marriage, women faced with widowhood,
and so on. Make no mistake: this is a book about relationships. It does,
however, provide a good look at Arab culture, and the quality of writing
is very high.
<p><br>


<i>The Jaguar Hunter</i>, Lucius Shepard 
<p>
This collection short stories of billed as a genre-spanning work dealing
with magic and existentialism. Perhaps it is. The stories tend to be of
the 'gringos encountering South American culture' variety, though there
are a few gems. The collection as a whole shows a lot of promise, and is
therefore slightly disappointing; many of these could have been written
by a mass-market author like Stephen King or Peter Straub.
<p><br>

<i>The Wind From Nowhere</i>, J. G.Ballard 
<p>
J. G. Ballard has the habit of taking a relatively normal phenomena,
in this case high winds, and running with it to the point of
doomsday. In this novel, winds increase 5 mph per day ... non-stop.
As usual, Ballard focuses on the struggles of individuals to survive
as the winds erode civilization. As with all of Ballard's stuff, it is
entertaining stuff -- great for a train or plane ride.
<p><br> 

<i>Syrup</i>, Max Barry 
<p>
This is the tale of Scat, a self-professed marketing genius who hooks up
[or tries to, at any rate] with 6, another self-professed marketing
genius. If you like send-ups of marketing, Los Angeles, and pretentious
hipster/emo culture, you'll love this book. Not as phenomenally great as
<i>Jennifer Government</i>, and obviously a first novel, but still worth
a read.
<p><br>

<i>Doctor Sleep</i>, Madison Smartt Bell
<p>
Ah, my favorite style of book: a study in insomnia. I think I was actually
sleeping well before I read this. A hypnotist in London, obsessed with
Giordano Bruno, wakes up to find his girlfriend gone and his life going
awry. As happens with sleeplessness, the narrator gets more and more
confused as time progresses, losing some minor motor control and more
than a little of his ability to deal with other people. A definite must-read
to keep you company on your next bout of insomnia.
<p><br>

<i>Light</i>, M John Harrison
<p>
The trade paper edition of this book has an endorsement from Iain Banks on
the cover, which is fairly prophetic: the novel is reminiscent of some of
Banks' best stuff. In fact, the parallels with <i>Walking On Glass</i> are
too many to ignore: three threads run through the main novel, including
two from the future and one following a madman in contemporary times. The
two futuristic threads are vaguely cyberpunk, and both start off with a
weary profusion of tech jargon. Luckily the contemporary thread carries 
the novel well enough until things get into swing. Hardcore techies and
physicists will probably be exasperated beyond belief with this book;
the average hard-SF fan will most likely enjoy it. Don't let the Neil 
Gaiman endorsement dissuade you.
<p><br>

<i>City of Saints and Madmen</i>, Jeff Vandermeer
<p>
Subtitled "The Book of Ambergris" and consisting of four short works set in
the fantasy city of Ambergris, this book is surprisingly well done. The
first story, "Dradin, in Love", is an amusing if somewhat predictable tale
of an infatuated priest; it serves well as an introduction to the world of
Ambergris. This is followed by a faux historical document entitled 
"The Hoegbotton Guide to the Early History of Ambergris", written in the
voice of a cynical historian whose footnotes get more amusing as the 
history moves on. "The Transformation of Martin Lake", the third story,
is by far the best; it chronicles the awakening of an artist and the 
subsequent implications on his career. The book ends with a fictional
autobiography, if it can be called that, of the author discussing his
work and defending Ambergris in "The Strange Case of X". All in all, a 
good read, and head and shoulders above the usual swill served up as fantasy.

<i>The Compiler Design Handbook</i>, Y N Srikant and P Shankar
<p>
An excellent collection of articles on compiler design, though with its fair 
share of overly-academic papers. Essays include "Automatic Generation of
Code Optimizers from Formal Specifications", "Scalar Compiler Optimizations
on the Statis Single Assignment", "Shape Analysis and Applications", 
"Data Flow Testing", "Program Slicing", "Debuggers for Programming Languages",
"Instruction Selection Using Tree Parsing", "Instruction Scheduling",
"Dynamic Compilation", "Compiling Safe Mobile Code", and quite a few others that
are more esoteric. Overall this is a very good book; anyone interested in
compilers should consider it a must-buy. Being a collection of articles, though,
the quality, practicality, and readability of each is variable. In the end,
though, it is the information that counts, and this book contains enough
recent compiler theory to justify its hefty cover price.
<p><br>

<i>Principles of Program Analysis</i>, Flemming Nielson, Hanne Nielson and Chris Hankin
<p>
This book is up to the usual high quality of Springer mathematical and 
programming texts, but programmers and casual readers may find it too
theoretical. The chapter list reads like a treasure trove of compiler and
code analysis topics: Data Flow Analysis, Constraint-Based Analysis, Abstract
Interpretation, etc. The book, however, reads like a math text: plenty of 
proofs that the algorithms work, with no practical examples or implementation
concerns. This is a great theoretical book: it does the job of teaching the
concepts and algorithms well ... just don't expect to be able to turn around
the next day and write a constraint-based anaysis utility.
<p><br>


<i>Hacker's Delight</i>, Henry S. Warren, Jr
<p>
Bit manipulation, mathematical short-cuts, exotic number bases, gray codes ...
it's all here. If you code at the assembly or kernel level, or if you really
want to get the most out of each line of C, this is the book for you. A review
on the back says "it deserves a spot on your shelf right next to Knuth", and
I cannot think of higher praise than that. This book is full of short, useful
programming tricks that can be implemented in any language capable of bit
manipulation. If nothing else, it is worth reading for interview questions
now that everyone is familiar with the "xor a, b; xor b, a; xor a, b" one.
<p><br>


<i>Engineering a Compiler</i>, Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon
<p>
Finally, a decent compiler book! This text does an excellent job of covering
all of the compiler bases [scanning, parsing, intermediate representation,
analysis/optimization, code generation] in a manner that is at once practical
and theoretically sound. Those who have read other compiler books can skip
through roughly half of this one and get right down to the meat, while those
new to compiler writing will find enough of the beginner material to get them
up to speed. Details such as the specification of their own IR, examples of
input [source code] from real-world programming languages, construction and
analysis of parse trees, and specific optimization techniques abound. At 
the same time, more abstract discussions covering instruction selection,
the behavior of control-flow constructs and procedures, and the tradeoffs
of memory-based code versus register-based code are provided to supplement
the implementation details. Overall the book is a nice read, informative, and
fairly comprehensive. If you buy one compiler book, make it this one.
<p><br>

<i>Graph Theory and Its Applications</i>, Jonathan Gross and Jay Yellen
<p>
Well, it's Graph Theory. If you get one book on Graph Theory, it should 
probably be this one ... a more apt title would have been <i>The Encyclopedia
of Graph Theory</i>, for indeed the book is fairly comprehensive. Still, it 
is a math book, be prepared for lots of Definitions, Assertions, and Proofs 
along with rather disappointing Exercises. There are some psuedocode 
algorithms, which is refreshing, but ultimately this is a book to prepare you
for talking about graphs, not doing anything with them. In short, a typical
mathematical treatement of the subject.
<p><br>

<i>Algorithms</i>, Richard Johnsonbaugh and Marcus Schaefer
<p>
The first six chapters of this book cover the same old "data structures and
sorting" topics that are in every other compiler text; useful for the beginner,
but really only worth skimming to get used to the terminology and pseudocode of
the authors. The last six chapters deal with typical "advanced" topics (greedy
algorithms, dynamic programming, and P/NP complexity) as well as two nice
chapters on Text Searching and Parallel Algorithms. These last two chapters 
are really where the book earns its keep, though naturally it cannot approach
the Cormen book for coverage. Get this if you need a good algorithm book that
is more portable and an easier read than the Cormen, or if you just like
collecting algorithm books.
<p><br>

<i>An Introduction to Signal Theory</i>, John R. Pierce
<p>
As an introductin to information theory, this book is quite good. It is short,
clear, and well written; I actually read it on the plane. In the last half
of the book, the author digresses on to various topics that he is excited to
apply information theory to, so you will get his views on art, psychology,
physics, and so forth. I skipped these. The casual reader may wish to linger
on them as they do seem interesting; however my aim was to gain familiarity
with terms and concepts I was coming across in handling digitalized analog
signals, and this book combined with my DSP book have taken care of that.
<p><br>

<i>Antipatterns</i>, William J Brown and Raphael C Malveau et. al.
<p>
Billed as something of a 'recipe for disaster' book, with examples of
dangerous practices and how to avoid or repair them. As the BBC newsmen
would say, total bollocks. This book is filled with broad generalizations
and basic concepts. It follows modern poorly-written-IT book trend by
breaking the text into small bullet-point chunks and sidebars, apparently
for middle managers since anyone with an attention span greater than a gnat
will find this the literary equivalent of conversing with the crackhead on
the corner about project management techniques. There is also, of course, 
the host of amateurish illustrations, likely drawn by one of the contributors
or their children, that server to confuse ideas more than clarify them. The
text is driven by an attempt to reduce everything to pyramid hierarchies, 
flowcharts, and bullet points, which I am sure would prompt Freud to mouth
off about the authors cramming objects in their nether regions. Many of the
Amazon reviews claimed that those not liking the book did not understand it;
how one could not understand banal insights like 'the blob', 'the god complex',
and 'the man afraid of change' is beyond mean. That said, this is probably
a great book for your kids, if they can get past the dynamic value-added
synergy of the managerspeak.
<p><br>

<i>Refactoring</i>, Martin Fowler
<p>
I purchased this book because I was tackling a huge legacy DOS codebase that
had to be updated to Win32, ported to UNIX, and generally made maintainable.
After reading the first two chapters I tossed this book and went with what
I already knew, and likely saved a lot of time by doing so. <i>Refactoring</i>
is less a book on modernizing legacy software than it is a guide for 
converting non-object-oriented codebases to object-oriented ones. If this
is your idea of 'modernization' then this book will be a great help; 
otherwise, you will wonder how the author could ignore important topics 
like understanding unreadable/unmaintainable code, making monolithic code
more modular [without wasting time designing a class hierarchy], and
replacing components with viable third-party technologies [e.g. using a
relational DB instead of CSV files].
<p><br>

<i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr 
<p>
Obviously a classic in the field. The author relates a story where he
encountered a man reading his book on a plane, and asked what he thought
of it. "Nothing in here I don't know already" is the reply, and that is 
likely to be the reaction of anyone with a decent amount of experience
in the IT industry. The book is still a good read, however, and is 
valuable in that Brooks discusses the problems much more successfully
than most. Use this book to learn how to phrase your arguments to your
boss, or better yet make your boss read it himself.
<p><br>

<i>The Pragamtic Programmer</i>, Andrw Hunt and David Thomas
<p>
Excellent programming advice. This is not a career guide or a management
manual; it is a "lessons learned the hard way" book. Unlike books covering
programming 'schools', e.g. the Booch Method or Extreme Programming, this
book focusses on 'commen sense' practices that all programmers should
follow. While the novice programmer will gain little from this book, it
should be considered a must-read for those designing software, running
development projects, or starting a career in programming.

<i>Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton</i>, Edward Rice
<p>
A continually interesting biography, written by a man who seems to understand
Burton's interests, motives, and beliefs almost as much as Burton himself. 
Perhaps overly sympathetic, given Burton's perpetual failures in expeditionary
as well as entrepenuerial ventures, but well-informed and providing an 
in-depth character study on one of the most intriguing adventurers of the 
Victorian era. For the ill-informed, Burton was the translator of the
<i>Kama Sutra</i> and the version of <i>The Arabian Nights</i> that is most
widely read by English speakers, as well as of numerous tomes on African,
Indian, and Arabian lands.
<p><br>

<i>No Logo</i>, Naomi Klein
<p>
A book such as this one is necessarily going to consist of preaching to the 
converted; it is a commentary, a self-styled manifesto, rather than an 
investigative or ground-breaking work. The ideas presented are not new, and 
any reader familiar with <i>Adbusters</i> and <i>The Baffler</i> will learn 
nothing here. Despite this, <i>No Logo</i> is a good book: a fast read, crowded
with telling quotes and statistics. The first two parts, "No Space" and 
"No Jobs", offer reasonable accounts of the loss of [ad-free] public space and
the destruction of a skilled, productive labor force through the replacement 
of 'real jobs' with service positions at high-turnover franchises. The third 
part, "No Logo", is the manifesto portion of the book, and can safely be 
skipped. The afterword is noteworthy only in its feeble criticism of NeoCon-run 
American, a criticism that rightly should have been expanded into a new chapter 
or section since all of the recommended actions and attitudes of protest in 
"No Logo" will now easily earn the practitioner an 'enemy combatant' status 
and four bare walls in Guatanmo. All in all, it is good to read, and better 
to loan to the unsuspecting masses; it would have been better, however, for 
this to have been a serious work of investigative journalism with a solid 
premise and cartloads of studies and research. Then, maybe it would stand a 
chance of being taken seriously by those who aren't already following Klein's 
columns and who aren't already familiar with every source in her bibliography.
As the work stands, though, it is a preachy followup to Ritzer's much better
<i>McDonalization of Society</i>.

<i>East Asia at the Center</i>, Warren L Cohen
<p>
A survey of international relations in Eastern and Southeastern Asia since
the start of recorded history. The coverage is broad and, naturally, not
very deep, but significant events and political figures are well-covered.
The discussion focusses on the relations of Asian countries with each other
and with more foreign nations such as Rome, India, and the European powers.
Overall, a very interesting book, and useful for putting current events
into perspective.
<p><br>

<i>Tales of Old Japan</i>, A. R. Mitford
<p>
A reprint of Mitford's 1871 book on Japanese culture, from the
venerable Tuttle Publishing. The contents are quite a grab-bag: 
a selection of historical tales including the famous tale of 
The Forty-Seven Ronins, a good number of [mercifully short] fairy 
and horror tales, three sermons, and an appendix of essays concerning
Japanese customs. Not the best book on any of these subjects, but
a decent all-in-one volume with the original woodcuts.
