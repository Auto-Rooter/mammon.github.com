	  Source code recovery, the goal of which is to reproduce the source code

	  written.

	  <font color=000080>
     Source code recovery, or <i>decompilation</i>, is the most difficult 
     goal to achieve in reverse engineering. The intent is to produce not 
     just a compilable version of a binary executable, but a version which is 
     also in the language which the executable was originally written in.<P>
     Naturally, recovery of the exact original source code is impossible; even 
     if debug information is present, the comments in the code will have been 
     stripped by the compiler, and any preprocessor macros will have been 
     expanded. Nevertheless, source code can be produced which will compile on 
     the same development platform as used in the original.<P>
     The process of source code recovery entails what amounts to a reversal of 
     the compilation procedure; the binary must be disassembled, and the 
     resulting assembly language passed through parsers which will create 
     successively more abstract [or <i>higher level</i>] interpretations of 
     patterns in the assembly code. Once a sufficiently high-level interpretation 
     of the code is produced -- that is, one which contains primtives that directly 
     map to structures and elements in the target high level language [sometimes 
     referred to as the <i>HLL</i>] -- the working interpretation can be translated 
     into that language with a final parser or lexical analyzer.<P>
