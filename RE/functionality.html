	  Very basic disassembly, with the intent of determining how the target 
	  circumvents a particular coding problem. This is usually a matter of
	  examining library calls and system calls or interrupts, though there
	  may be some examination of data structures and algorithms as well.

	  <font color=000080>
	  When a program is to be re-coded rather than re-compiled, it is 
	  necessary to identify functionality which is unique to the program 
	  in order to replicate it. For the most part, such a task is concerned 
	  primarily with determining the OS and shared library routines invoked 
	  by the program, as well as any specific hardware that is accessed. 
	  <P>
	  This differs from the act of recovering subroutines or of decompiling in 
	  that disassembled executable code is often of no consequence; quite often 
	  the use of an undocumented interface, or the abnormal use of a documented 
	  interface, will provide the key needed to rewrite the program. A look at 
	  the specific memory locations, ports, system calls, and library routines 
	  referenced by a program will prove sufficient in most cases, and the 
	  overall program logic is of little or no interest.
	  <P>
	  Such techniques are virtually useless for porting programs, as they assume 
	  the future program will run on the same platform as the target. As such this 
	  is primarily an educational technique, useful in learning how to use 
	  undocumented interfaces, or to gain the information necessary to write a 
	  third-party device driver.
