	  Rudimentary file analysis, often requiring no special tools or 
	  techniques. The goal is to determine information about the target 
	  such as the file type, the application or OS it was written for, 
	  and any special libraries or interpreters required by the target.

	  <font color=000080>
	  There are times when it is not necessary to reverse engineer the code 
	  of a file, for only basic information about the file is needed. 
	  This may be the case when a file fails to run because required files
	  or shared libraries are missing, when the command-line parameters of 
	  a file need to be determined, or if the OS required to run the file 
	  is unknown.<P>
	  Obtaining information about a file is the lowest, most simple form 
	  of reverse engineering -- often overlooked as it often only requires 
	  a string search of the target, or a quick parsing of the file headers.
	  It is, however, a skill essential to working on files without the 
	  benefit of documentation.<P>
	  Note that to obtain any reliable information from a target, it must be
	  known what type of file it is. One could, by way of contrived example,
	  spend hours mistakenly parsing a data file in search of compiler or
	  OS information. If the file type or format is unknown, much more work 
	  is required, as detailed in the <a href="format.html">File Format</a>
	  section.<P>
