	  <i><font size=-1>
	  Full disassembly, the goal of which is to produce a recompilable 
	  assembly language source code of the target program. To be distinguished
	  from source code recovery in that it does not produce code for the 
	  original compiler of the target.

	  <!--  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Background -->
     <font color=000080>
	  The purpose of disassembly is to obtain a compilable version of a 
	  binary executable. In simple operating systems, with simple programs,
	  this is not too difficult. Parsing the file into its component 
	  sections, fixing any absolute address references, and formatting the 
	  code for its future assembler are services that can be provided by 
	  any quality disassembler.<P>
	  With large or complex programs, or with an OS that allows dynamic 
	  linking and other forms of referencing volatile external addresses, 
	  things become more difficult. Larger programs result in a greater chance 
	  of error, and address or register references which work at runtime may 
	  fail to assemble. <P>
     Disassembly must be viewed as a complete reversal of the compilation 
     process. The typical compilation of a binary executable is as follows:<P>
	  <center><table width=60%>
	  <tr><td bgcolor=FFFFFF><center>High-Level Source</td>
	      <td><font color=000000>--Compiler--&gt</td>
			<td bgcolor=FFFFFF><center>Assembly Source</td>
	      <td><font color=000000>--Assembler--&gt</td>
			<td bgcolor=FFFFFF><center>Object File</td>
			<td><font color=000000>--Linker--&gt</td>
			<td bgcolor=FFFFFF><center>Binary executable</td>
			</tr></table></center>
         <P>
     The compiler formats the high-level language into assembler instructions -- 
     it is this assembly code that a disassembly endeavors to recover. In the 
     next step of compilation, the assembler generates object code by translating 
     assembler mnemonics into machine opcodes. Finally, a linker combines related 
     object code into a single executable, creates the file header and component 
     sections, and formats exported symbols and external references according to 
     the requirements of the OS loader/dynamic linker. <P>
     Note that the linker can also embed pre-generated object code, such as the 
     code libraries shipped with professional compilers and development 
     environments [e.g. STDLIB, the C standard library; MFC, the Microsoft C++ 
     class hierarchy; and VCL, the Borland/Inprise C++ class hierarchy]. This 
     embedded code can be recognized by <i>signatures</i> [byte sequences within 
     the code that are specific to the compiler/vendor and the embedded routine] 
     and replaced in the disassembly with calls to the library code, thereby 
     simplifying the disassembled code.<P>
