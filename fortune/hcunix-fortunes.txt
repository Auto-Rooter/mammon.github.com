  <mkfs> the german language is all about pressing unrelated words into service
         as compound nouns
  <mkfs> like verbal press-ganging
  <mkfs> whereas english is more
  <mkfs> verbal gang-banging
  <halvar> mkfs: english verbal gang-bangs are significantly shorter than german
           verbal gang-bang . Does this imply a lack of endurance ?

  <halvar> english is a language that you can never speak as a native
  <halvar> as it has hardly any "rules"
  <halvar> just exceptions
  <mkfs> i disagree
  <mkfs> it is a language you can only speak as a native
  <mkfs> cause otherwise it makes no fucking sense
  <mkfs> and you always end up sounding like a foreigner ;P
  <grugq_> exactly
  <mkfs> there is only one rule in english

	-- ESL, Lesson 1
%
  <halvar> well, you are not allowing it to call
  <mkfs> right
  <mkfs> which is not disallowing
  <halvar> so it is "not allowed to make a call"
  <mkfs> right
  <halvar> so it is "disallowed to make a call"
  <mkfs> nope
  <grugq_> no
  <mkfs> disallowed != 'not allowed'
  <halvar> see where logic & english gets you ?
  <mkfs> disallowed *means* not allowed
  <mkfs> but they are different
  <mkfs> specifically
  <mkfs> no-one says disallowed
  <mkfs> you're breaking the only rule of english
  <halvar> jesus fucking christ
  <halvar> why dont' you kids get yourself a "language" ?
  <halvar> which has rules, grammar & structure ?
  <grugq_> we have one
  <grugq_> its called C
	
	-- ESL, Lesson 2
%
  <mkfs> usually things are just disallowed. period. Not disallowed from
          anything, just disallowed in general.
  <grugq_> it is weird, innit?
  <grugq_> its an archaic word, basicly.
  <mkfs> yeah
  <grugq_> only has 1 use
  <grugq_> "the ref has disallowed the goal"
  <mkfs> but it appeals to the german mind
  <mkfs> because it is one-character more effcient that "not allowed"
  <grugq_> but during run time, it takes an extra cycle to compute
