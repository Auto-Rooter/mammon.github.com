<LI><B>12.02</b> <i>Stoppard</i>: For those of you who did not know, I have long been a fan of 
<a href="http://www.infind.com/infind/infind.exe?query=Tom+Stoppard&time=7&x=54&y=15">Tom
Stoppard</a>'s works. Apparently my favorite bit of <a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~rbell/relthing.htm">Stoppard dialogue</a> 
--I think I had <a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~rbell/relthing.htm">this</a> very argument 
with a girlfriend-- is appreciated by <a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~rbell/">others</a> as well.
And again, gratitude to kuririn for the <a href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/thoughts.html">poetry</a>.
Finally, the more discriminating readers of this site may enjoy some, albeit non-Stoppard,
<a href="http://eserver.org/drama/short.html">short</a> and
<a href="http://eserver.org/drama/long.html">long</a> plays.
<LI><B>11.29</b> <i>Philosophy with a Torque Wrench</i>: Awhile ago Harma and I had pretty cool
thread going on Fravia's Message Board, and having nothing better to do I decided to upload it here before the
board shuffles off this mortal coil. <a href="parti.txt">Part I</a> was the longest and the one I
enjoyed the most--though no-one got my Steven Brust "bones?" reference. Or maybe they did...
<a href="Partii.txt">Part II</a> is missing my long response as my Netscape crashed right when I
hit send; thus this thread has always been missing my tender invective.
<a href="Partiii.txt">PartIII</a> concerns one of my favorite topics: the worth (or lack thereof) to
which humanity lays claim.
<LI><B>11.29</b> <i>Flow Analyzer</i>: Rev 2. Now exports IDC scripts, has a few new features
and a <i>killer</i> IDC script for the main call trace. Get it below...
<LI><B>11.27</b> <i>Active X</i>: I just returned from an errand run wherein I picked up
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811212459/qid=912231865/sr=1-3/002-3607801-8858210">8 Stories</a> by Dylan Thomas,
<a href="http://www.lancutdistillery.euro-index.com.pl/polmosflavouredvodka.htm">Zytnia Vodka</a> and some Juliano dry vermouth,
and <a href="http://www.mrbunny.com/">Mr Bunny's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485362/n/qid=912232190/sr=2-1/002-3607801-8858210">Guide to Active X</a>. All are highly recommended (though I  like
D'Aquino vermouth best: does anyone even distribute that anymore?)
<li><B>11.27</b> <i>Win32ASM</i>: There is now an IRC channel/server for Windows Assembly Language at
#win32 asm or via the <a href="http://c71114-a.potlnd1.or.home.com/">web interface</a>, courtesy of 
Saqquara.

<LI><B>11.26</b> <i>Flow Analyzer</i>: I have started work on what should eventually turn into a useful reverse engineering tool. Those wishing a preview may 
<a href="FlowAnalyzer/FlowAnalyzer.zip">examine</a> it right now, though it has maybe a quarter of its intended functionality. If you do not understand what it is
or why it exists after the first usage, return it postage pre-paid for a full refund.
<LI><B>10.31</b> <i>Hiatus II</i>: The web is taking too much of time; following the message boards, trying to keep old projects alive, seeking out new things.
I'm behind on my Unix work, I'm behind on my programming, I'm behind on my writing, I'm behind on my painting, I'm even behind on my email. Cracking concerns and
questions keep dragging me back to the Windows platform when I am now on Linux (and never want to go back!). So I'm giving up the ol' web for the time being, I am henceforth going to
ignore my site, the message boards, and any cracking/help requests related to the Windows platform (unless they're *really* intriguing). I will of course still answer email. I will be on ICQ.
I will continue to work on the APJ, though Visual Assembler I quite frankly do not have time for. Perhaps I'll return in a few weeks/months, perhaps even with a newer incarnation of my page ;)
<LI><B>10.31</b> <i>APJ</i>: I need more articles for the December issue! Anything to do with assembly language programming, even code snippets... Check the <a href="http://pluto.beseen.com/boardroom/q/19784/">Message Board</a>, <a href="mailto:mammon_@hotmail.com">mail me</a>, or
check out the <a href="http://asmjournal.freeservers.com/fsguestbook.html">APJ Guestbook</a>. Also, the freeservers site has horrivle uptime, so I have mirrored it <a href="APJ/index.html">here</a>.
<LI><B>10.31</b> <i>Visual Assembler</i>: I do not have time to co-ordinate this project. I do have time to advise, and to help work on it. I have the addresses, etc. of all the coders and interested parties,
but I am not going to bug them about working (apologies to all who have expressed interest in the past 1-2 months, I will reply to you eventually). So, in short, I need a successor to co-ordinate design plans with,
to take over the daily duties of the project (moderating the message board, maintaining contact with the coders, etc)--any interested parties may <a href="mailto:mammon_@hotmail.com">email me</a>.

<LI><B>10.16</b> <i>Assembly Programming Journal</i>: <i>APJ</i> first Issue is out! Also, looking for successor to handle Visasm project in my absence.
<LI><B>9.16</b> <i>Linux Source</i>: Two cool kernel source navigators are available for Linux. The one at 
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/linux-source/">Sunsite</a> is alright, but I very much prefer the
<a href="http://zaphod.ethz.ch/linux/kernel-2.1/">Zaphod</a> server (must be my Beeblebrox fetish). A couple of other good
linux pages include the <a href="http://www.ngs.fi/lsm/">Linux Software Map</a> and the <a href=http://www.linuxprogramming.com/">Linux Programming</a> page.
<LI><B>9.03</b> <i>ASM Programming Journal</i>: <font color=ffffff><blink>!Writers Wanted!</blink></font> So I had this idea, and it has yet to be determined whether or not it is a good one. I am looking at starting an online magazine 
(dist via email and web) dedicated to assembly language, as there seems to be a renewed interest in this style of programming. The magazine would be a platform for publishing/exchanging 
routines, optimization tips, weird asm tricks (virii, polymorphism, etc), HOW-TOs, assembler-specific coding, etc--any and every trick there is to asm coding. Of course, this is a magazine and not a web page, 
meaning that I will edit and contribute but there is no way I can do the whole thing. The Journal has a rudimentary web page <a href="http://asmjournal.freeservers.com/">here</a>, as 
well as a <a href="http://pluto.beseen.com/boardroom/q/19784/">discussion board</a> for
posting article ideas, etc --hell, why not one more, after all they're free eh?
<LI><B>9.02</b> <i>Coding</i>: Some interesting things in the magazine this month. <i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i> has for October an app called BugSlayer that I haven't looked at yet; however  
the real good stuff is in the September issue with Pietrek's ModuleList program (a follow up to NukeDLL) and a utility called Control Spy; the source for these programs may be downloaded 
by issue at the MSJ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/code.htm">source code</a> site. <i>Windows Developer Journal</i> features an article by Sven Schreiber (of Walk32 fame) on customizing the WinMain 
function for Win32 programs (useful technique if you're into code generators); source for the current issue can be downloaded from WDJ's <a href="http://www.wdj.com/code/">site</a>. While out traipsing the web for this source I came across the following 
very good coding and "coding theory" links: 
<a href="http://www.netalive.org/codersguild/contents.html">Coder's Guild</a>, 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Magazines/">Yahoo: Programming Magazines</a>, 
<a href="http://www.netti.fi/~simos/oasis/">Programmer's Oasis</a>, 
<a href="http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~kanada/programming.html">Programming & Computational Languages: A Subject Guide</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/language-research.html">Resources for Programming Language Research</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.nullstone.com/htmls/connections.htm">The Compiler Connection</a>. 
<LI><B>8.31</b> <I>Book Exchange</i>: One of my side projects has coincided with similar efforts from a few others and there is now an  
attempt to create an online book exchange to enable the sharing of information. Ideas on how to manage such an endeavor as well as  
possible resources for sharing would be welcome.  
<LI><B>8.08</b> <I>Wrox Source</i>: Does anyone out there have the source (or the pdf file ;) to the book <b>Revolutionary Guide To Bitmapped Graphics</b> by Wrox Press?   
I am interested in checking out the code at the very least, but cannot see paying US$40 for material that has been covered many times over on the web (and, therefore, on my hard drive ;).   
<LI><B>8.08</b> <I>Miscellaneous</i>: The length of time between updates to this site is a measure of how busy I am.   
The links page needs a rework, there are more "tales" to polish off and upload, not to mention the first two tales which were never finished.   
But on to the news...  CrackZ has put up an excellent <a href="http://www.zencrack.org">page</a> and fortunately posted it to Scenelink, where    
I found myself recently; ZenCrack may be a little  orcish in the title, but there is a lot of good info there, plus a ton of material for    
the beginner--it is good to see a page arise that like the "main three" (greythorne, caligo, fravia) can stand on its own.    
Another excellent site is <a href="http://www.la-online.com/">LA Online</a>, with ASM links/tutes/info, virus coding, reality cracking, Picasso Pics,    
bits of Nietzche and a dash of S&M, all done with a certain graphic style...what else would you expect from LA?    
Miscellaneous virii info/source/etc can be found at <a href="http://www.codebreakers.org/frames.htm">CodeBreakers</a>, and every "zine" you will ever need    
can be found either at <a href="http://www.giga.or.at/pub/hacker/zines">Giga</a> or at <a href="http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/">Etext</a> (be <b>sure</b> to read <i>BOFH</i>).    
Also, there is an <a href="http://www.sandpile.org/forum/index.shtml">Assembly Language Forum</a> hosted by Sandpile (in fact there are a few of these around; see the    
new section below). And no update would be complete without mention of the new    
<a href="http://203.148.211.201/visasm">home</a> for Visual Assembler (with the Fortunecity page retained as a mirror),    
hosted by Iczelion (who has his own very fantastic <a href="http://203.148.211.201/index.html">page</a>).   
   
   
<LI><b>7.20</b> <I>Win32 Coding</i>: While fruitlessly searching for information on writing a registry editor I came across the   
following interesting essays on M$oft's site, some of which I had read and some which I had not:   
at the base URL for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/wcnt.htm">Win32 Development</a>, there are essays on  
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/base/pagetest.htm">DLL Rebasing<a/>,   
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/base/mmfile.htm">Memory-Mapped Files<a/>,

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/ui/shellex2.htm">Shell Extensions<a/>. There are also pages for  
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Downloads/default.asp?custarea=bus&site=family&openmenu=winres&highlighteditem=in this section">software downloads</a> and   
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Solutions/default.asp?custarea=bus&site=family&openmenu=winres&highlighteditem=in this section">demos</a>.   
My original question, however, remains unanswered: <b>How can one code a registry editor that will view/edit/import/export   
information in an <i>off-line</i> registry</b>, that is, from the component .dat files? I have a need for such an editor   
quite often, yet the technique used by standard resource editors is the RegConnectRegistry API function provided by   
ADVAPI32, which will connect to a computer and load the open "key handle" to its registry. I suppose what is needed is to trace through   
the initial registry initialization at startup and mimic the loading code in an editor, a terrible amount of work. (Note 8.15: got some   
interesting ideas from Spyder and Imation on this--thanks guys :). One more thing--and thanks to Pr0t0n for responding with the stub thing--I know  
about the regedit DOS stub; I just have the take the time to reverse it and port it to a Win32 App like regedit. Perhaps in October. Hmm, it's amazing  
how many people out there like playing with the registry :)   
   
<LI><b>7.06</b> <I>Batch File Programming</i>: DOS batch-file programming is tedious and difficult--like coding with one   
hand and four of the next one's fingers tied behind your back--but it is challenging and it does force you to be clever   
(much like hunting with a stone axe will make you a more clever hunter than if you used, say, a .30-06). Some very helpful   
hints can be found at the <a href="http://www.calweb.com/~webspace/batch/index.htm">DOS batch Programming</a> page,    
at <a href="http://www.maem.umr.edu/~batch/">DOS Batch Language: A personal View</a>,

<LI><b>7.02</b> <I>Search Bookmarks</i>: A Netscape bookmark file of current search engines (plus a few bonuses ;) is now    
available at <a href="search.html">search.html</a>: import it into your Netscape bookmarks and it will appear as the subfolder    
"Search". Current plans include similar bookmark files for programming and security links; recommendations of <b>stable pages</b>    
are welcome.     
   
<LI><b>5.02</b> <I>Visual Assembler</i>: <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/lycos/403">Visual Assembler</a> will be a Win32 IDE for assembly programming that will apply RAD programming techniques to the asm language. Despite Kauler's demonstration of how to implement classes in TASM, this will <i>not</i> be    
a "Visual" tool that relies on class libraries (like C   Builder, VB, Delphi, and MFC do) but rather will be made up of a number of .asm modules (as per the programming method you may remember from reading    
your Peter Norton asm book, modular assembly: no surprises here) that use the Win32 API for their "objects" (therefore you need no extra DLLs and your program ships small!). The coding for this will not be too     
difficult but will be tedious as there will be a lot of it. I am looking for both asm coders for the modules and C coders for the IDE as I hate coding. This project is going to be produced and distributed for    
<b>free</b> (as fits with my philosophy) in accordance with the GNU license or something similar. Work is being done in conjunction with the HCU as that is where the most interest lies; however anyone may     
contribute without being a member or affiliate of the HCU (<a href="mailto:mammon_@hotmail.com">contact</a> me for more info). The more who contribute, the more features there will be and the quicker it will get through beta!    
   
<LI><b>4.28</b> <i>Forum</i>: Yes, the forum is down. No, I do not know why. This is what comes of using somebody else's code.     
I have set up a

made up of cracking sites, meaning there will be a lot of "look-what-our-group-did" sites, but still there should be a few pages with valuable information.      
   
<LI><b>3.31</b> <i>Java</i>: <a href="http://kimera.cs.washington.edu/disassembler.html">Kimera</a> is an online Java disassembler viewing Java bytecodes rather than Java source code; the bytecodes can then

<LI><b>1.10</b> <i>Hiatus</i>: No explanation. This page is now on hiatus. It may be updated, but only infrequently.             
<LI><b>1.09</B> <i>CrackPC</i>: Wouldn't it be great if the Soft-Ice Command Reference was less than 3 MB, did not require a postscript reader,             
and was searchable? Now it is: check out <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/littleitaly/machievelli/31/crackpc.zip">crackpc.zip</a>!             
   
<LI><b>1.05</b> <i>Browser wars</i>: New Browser avail from www.operasoftware.com (Thanks to MP5 for info): 1.19MB download,             
2.11MB installed, allegedly more stable than Netscape or MSIE (maybe...I only crashed it once!). Good UI,             
easy to use, v-e-r-y configurable. Patch offset 46E23 from 7436 to EB5F and it's yours forever. [beta 11 only]             
   
<LI><b>1.01</b> <i>Layout</i>: This page was designed on Netscape 3.01 with 24-bit color @ 800x600 resolution, using 11pt Courier New as the default font. May the gods help you if you use otherwise...  </font></td></tr></table>
