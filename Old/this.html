  A radical departure from my previous site, I am sure. Due to space constraints     
  at Angelfire, as well as the delaying of uploaded files until "approved", this     
  site has been rebuilt at Eccentrica: a more fitting host, with a more fitting     
  name. In addition, a Reverse Engineering <a href="http://disc.server.com/discussion.cgi?id=37">Forum</a>     
  has been provided by the <a href="http://server.com/WebApps/">WebApps</a> Server     
  Corporation, which has saved me a lot of code writing--by all means pay a visit     
  and leave a question or an answer behind.<P>     
  <font size=-1><b>An important note:</b> Like the authors of similar pages, I have received a number     
  of "how do I find xxx" and "how do you crack xxx" emails; to follow suit with the     
  "similar pages" I will state my policy upfront. Requests for cracks: I only accept     
  these from personal friends, and even then somewhat begrudgingly; if you are working     
  on a crack and seek help or advice, you are more than welcome...requests simply for     
  cracks are referred to the many cracks/serials lists out there (type the name of your     
  target program and "cracks" or "serialz" or "warez" in, say, Yahoo and you will do     
  fine). Requests for software: available to colleagues, hcu members, etc; I believe in     
  the dispensing of tools for "our work", if you will, but only to those who do     
  such work. Others: goto ftpsearch, type in the name of the exe or zip file you are     
  looking for (if you have found a broken link, use the filename from that link) or a     
  plausible approximation (eg sice95.zip), and search...you will do well.</font><P>     
   Most of my former pages have focussed     
  on reverse engineering and assembly language; these topics have been reproduced     
  here under this new format, collected under the <a href="tales.html">Tales</a>     
  page. Previous pages on the 95/NT Registry and the ill-fated Java/Javascript     
  page will make their way here in due time. Gluttons for punishment are referred     
  to the brief section of <a href="#links">related sites</a> posted at the bottom     
  of this page. If you are surprised that your page is not on this list, then by     
  all means let <a href="mailto:mammon_@hotmail.com">me</a> know all about it.<P>     
  Those who have frequented the old site may wish to jump directly to the <a href="asmintro.html">Assembly</a>,     
  <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>, <a href="reverse1.html">Reverse Engineering</a>,     
  or <a href="ice.html">Soft-Ice</a> pages. These works have now been collected     
  under the <a href="tales.html">Tales</a> section; the extensive <a href="tools.html">Tools</a>     
  and the obscure <a href="links.html">Links</a>  sections have been carried over     
  as well. And, as ever, there is the lengthy<a href="registry.html">95 Registry</a>     
  page. The old page/format at Angelfire will be maintained at the original <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca/mammon">site</a>,     
  but all of its links now point here--if you have linked to any of the "essay"     
  sub-pages on the Angelfire server, you may want to re-link them here as the Angelfire     
  pages will <font color=FF0000>not</font> be updated. Note that those who prefer     
  the old Angelfire format can access it <a href="old.html">here</a> at Eccentrica     
  as well.<P>

<font color=808080 Face="Courier"><P><BR>     
	This page has been set up primarily as a resource for the "bete noir" of programming, Reverse Engineering. In essence, Reverse Engineering appears deceptively simple:     
to regain the original source code from a compiled, functional exectuable file should be fairly straightforward. Right?<P>Wrong. The Intel x86 instruction set is very complex, and contains a lot of redundancies. The complexity results mostly from Intel's memory addressing scheme, in which offsets     
which are referred to by the programmer can reside in any number of 64K (64 thousand, not 64 Kilobyte) segments; in addition, there is no standard sequence for interleaving data     
and actual code in a program, so that a disassembler must make multiple passes in examining the program to determine what is actual code and what is, in fact, data. The redundancy     
inherent in the x86 instruction set is due to machine-code functions that have multiple mnemonics in order to make the assembly language somewhat more intuitive for the programmer;     
as a quick example the functions JZ (Jump If Zero) and JE (Jump If Equal) both translate to Jump If Zero Flag Is Set (or Jmp ZF=1), which translates to 74 hex in machine code...yet     
the clarity of the surrounding code will depend on whether the instruction is testing the result of an equality test or a "zero-ing" test.<P>So what exactly is required in order to properly Reverse Engineer? 1) Time. And lots of it. I know this because I have none.... 2) An intimate knowledge of assembly language (ASM),     
and a general familiarity with high-level languages such as C/C  , Pascal, Visual Basic (well, some people call it a language), and generally any language that the target program     
might have been written in (Java, Perl, Fortan). 3) Books. The amount of reference material you need, either on- or off-line, is staggering: an Op-codes listing (a listing of the     
assembler mnemonics and their hexidecimal machine-code equivalents), a list of OS and BIOS services, hardware and programming documentation of APIs, port numbers, etc. 4) Tools.     
The more tools you have, the less reference material you are likely to need. Good software tools (such as disassemblers, resource editors, etc.) pull information from the executable     
itself and will save you a ton of research. 5) Perseverance. If you have excellent concentration and a bulldog-like determination, Reverse Engineering is the sport for you.<P>Is it wrong? Like so many other things in life, it depends on what you do with it. There is nothing wrong with Reverse Engineering a program out of curiosity to see how it works;     
it is considered wrong to steal code gained by Reverse Engineering a product, and the art of "cracking" programs by Reverse-Engineering their protection schemes often brings cries     
of "software piracy". Most companies--given the chance--will not allow you to Reverse Engineer their products even if you are a registered owner; the code of the product, while     
lying visible for anyone with Debug.exe to read, is considered a trade secret. What it all boils down to is something that must be viewed rationally and with great practicality:     
with the popularity of the Internet: Knowledge (or software or code) is Free. Whether or not you make your knowledge/ code/ software available to the Internet or not, it will end     
up there, and someone will reverse-engineer it if it is interesting, someone will crack it if it is protected, and someone else will inevitably get a free ride.  The best you can     
do is either to a) throw on the heaviest protection scheme you can afford and charge enough so that the purchases of the people who can't crack your program will cover your losses,     
or b) provide the source code with the program and ask for donations. You will find that most of the software developers who choose to profit from their trade will follow one of     
these two courses.<P>Once again, is it wrong? In my view, no. If you have the wit and will to draw the source code from a 4 MB executable, then you deserve the routines that lie therein. If you can     
go one-on-one with a protection scheme and crack the program, you've won: it's yours. This is mostly a practical attitude: short of monitoring every PC in the world, you cannot     
stop a person from cracking or Reverse Engineering a product, so you might as well not exhaust yourself trying to prevent it. It would be nice if only those who were able could     
benefit from cracks, i.e. if they were only available within the "cracking community" (which, to some extent, they are), but the nature of the medium prevents that; any user can     
type "Winword Crack" on their search engine and pull up results.<P>
