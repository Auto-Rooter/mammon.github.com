<center><font size=+1><b>Setting up Windows 95 for ASM Programming</b></font></center>
Awhile back I posted to one of the various assembly language or cracking forums
a series of instructions for setting up Windows9x/NT4+ for assembly language programming;
apparently the configuration of the explorer GUI is not given much treatment.<P>

To this end I am including the set of instructions here as a supplement to the
APJ issues; it covers the basics of setting up file associations, Send To...
menu items, and New... menu items in the Explorer GUI.  <P><BR>

<i>Note: Any code samples headed by "REGEDIT 4", for example </i>
<code><pre>
REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm\ShellNew]
"NullFile"=""
</pre></code>
<i>are intended to be pasted into a reg file [e.g., a text file renamed to 1.reg] and
imported into the Registry either by double-clicking the reg file or by using the
Registry Editor [regedit.exe].</i><P>
<HR>
<P><BR>
<u>Making Notepad a "Send To..." option</u><P>
This is useful for quickly viewing files of any type in Notepad, simply by right-clicking
on the file and choosing "Notepad" from the "Send To..." submenu. Additional
programs [hex editors, disassemblers, compilers, debuggers] can be added in the
same manner.<p>
<OL>
  <LI>Put a shortcut to notepad.exe in the <code>C:\Windows\SendTo</code> directory
  <LI>Rename the shortcut to "Notepad"
</OL>
Simple enough. Further notes on the topic are that you can edit the command line
parameters [e.g. for DOS programs] of the shortcut, and that creating folders
withing <code>C:\Windows\SendTo</code> will create cascaded "Send To..." submenus.
<P>
<BR>
<u>Associating .asm files with Notepad</u><P>
This can be done through Explorer.exe, but you will learn more if you modify
the registry directly. This will also serve as an introduction for later
registry modification. <P>

<code><pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm]
"Content Type"="text/plain"
@="txtfile"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm\ShellNew]
"NullFile"=""
</pre></code>
Note that HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT contains all of the file extensions and file types
recognized as important by the OS, and that "txtfile" is associated with Notepad
[see HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile]. "@" stands for "default", as in the default value
for this registry key.
<P>
<BR>
<u>Creating a "DOS Prompt Here" Menu Item</u><P>
While writing or testing console-mode programs it is very useful to be able to
right-click on a directory icon in Explorer and select "DOS Prompt Here" from
the context menu, thus opening a DOS box with the selected directory as the current directory.
This feature was originally part of the Win95 Power Toys kit; for some reason it
has never made it into the standard OS options.
<pre><code>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\DOS Prompt Here\command]
@="c:\windows\command.com -K cd %1"
</pre></code>
Note that "Folder" is the object we are modifying [to encompass both "drive" and
"directory"], "shell" refers to the context menu, "DOS Prompt Here" is the item
we are adding to the context menu, and "command" is the command to be run when
that menu item is selected.
<P>
<BR>
<u>Creating a "New ASM File" MenuItem</u><P>
This is very handy for creating .ASM file templates that you can open by right-clicking
in a directory and selecting "ASM File" from the "New..." submenu.<P>

First, put an asm template called asm.asm in the <code>c:\windows\ShellNew</code> directory.
This is where all templates for the "New..." menu are stored.

<pre><code>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile]
@="Assembly Program"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\DefaultIcon]
@="C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\shell32.dll,-152"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\shell\open]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\shell\open\command]
@="C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE %1"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\shell\print]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\asmfile\shell\print\command]

@="C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE /p %1"
</pre></code>
What we have done here is to create a class similar to "txtfile" which contains
all of the necessary associations for .ASM files [open with "notepad", print with
"notepad /p"]. Now we must associate the .asm file extension with the "asmfile"
class, and make "asm.asm" the "New..." file:
<pre><code>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm]
"Content Type"="text/plain"
@="asmfile"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.asm\ShellNew]
"NullFile"="asm.asm"
</pre></code>

That's all for now ... happy reg editting!</BODY></HTML>
